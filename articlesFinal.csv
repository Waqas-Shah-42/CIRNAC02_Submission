And this year, thanks to\xa0Blackwolf\'s\xa0efforts,\xa0CAV\xa0has created new medallions to recognize the contributions of aboriginal veterans.Manitoba was the first to recognize Aboriginal Veterans Day\xa0in 1994, when a private member\'s resolution passed unanimously by the legislative assembly. The National Aboriginal Veterans War Memorial was unveiled in Ottawa on June 21, 2001. Since then many communities across Canada celebrate the dedication of aboriginal veterans on November 8.The\xa0CAV\xa0medallions\xa0help tell each person\'s own story: which era the person served, which department, if the person is a part of any special service (Rangers, for example)\xa0and their aboriginal heritage.This year\xa0instead of one heritage medallion, there are three: Native,\xa0Métis, and Inuit.Blackwolf says the word ""native"" was chosen over ""First Nations"" because it reflects both status Indians and non-status.""First Nations, it means they have a treaty with the government and non-status don\'t. So we didn\'t want to leave them out. We just call it \'native veterans\' because that\'s who we are, that includes everybody then,""\xa0Blackwolf\xa0said.""What better way to create awareness than to actually wear a medallion to say who you are.""Blackwolf\xa0was 10 when he first stepped inside a navy ship. His mother remarried in the 50s and his new family had a history with the navy near Victoria, B.C.When the ships were ported, he would go visit his uncle.""On Sundays, [I would] go with my uncle there and I was able to crawl around on the ships. One of the things I liked crawling around on were the guns,"" he said with a shy laugh.He was 18 when he became a member of the new analog navy in 1959.\xa0""When they asked if I was interested in being a sonar person, like sonar men, I jumped on that,"" he said.""It required higher education and it was all aimed at the new electronics,"" he said of the new system at the time.\xa0Blackwolf\xa0says the Navy trained him and gave him an education,\xa0spending seven\xa0years in school along the way.In 1970 he joined the second new digital navy and was employed out of Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.\xa0""I was in the lead there. I was one of the first few people that were chosen and sent down to Halifax and spent two\xa0years in school learning all of that,"" he said.Blackwolf\xa0was\xa0honourably\xa0discharged in 1972. He went on to work for the Department of National Defence for 25 years in the weapons department, working with navy ships and systems.Blackwolf\xa0says his career has taken him all over the world.""It was the Cold War era so we did a lot of patrolling out in the Pacific, looking for Russian submarines that would come and park on the continental shelf here,"" he said.""They had a habit of anchoring on a\xa0seamount,\xa0that was in Canadian waters, at night.""He was part of a crew that had to come up with distractions that would force them to leave.""Our job was to help the Americans. We used to beat around the mouth of the Strait of Juan de\xa0Fuca\xa0here and create all sorts of noise and everything.""This year, for National Aboriginal Veterans Day,\xa0Blackwolf\xa0will be spending time with Manitoba aboriginal veterans.Tiar WilsonTiar Wilson was raised in Opaskwayak Cree Nation, Manitoba.

['2015-04-24T20:18:50.882Z'],['First Nations pay more tax than you think'],['Aleksandra Sagan'],['https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/taxes/first-nations-pay-more-tax-than-you-think-1.2971040'],"['aThere\'s a common misconception in Canada that aboriginal people don\'t pay taxes, but, in fact, tax exemption applies to fewer than half of aboriginal Canadians — and even they have to have\xa0very specific work and living arrangements to benefit from it.Misunderstandings about aboriginal people and taxes ""absolutely"" exist\xa0— even among First Nations themselves, says\xa0Manny Jules, chair of the First Nations Tax Commission.""[Non-First Nations people] feel that no status Indian pays anything in terms of tax,"" he said. ""People do pay taxes\xa0— excise tax, income tax, sales tax\xa0— all of those.""Only some\xa0status Indians are exempt from paying taxes, and even then, it\'s in very specific situations.First Nations people who are recognized as status Indians\xa0under Section 6\xa0of\xa0the Indian Act\xa0may be eligible for some tax exemptions.The act has existed since 1876 and initially conferred Indian\xa0status on male members of certain bands, their children and their wives. Later amendments extended it to others\xa0who may have lost it over subsequent generations — women who married non-status men and their children, for example.In 2011, there were 637,660 registered status Indians, or slightly over\xa045\xa0per cent of aboriginal people living in Canada, according to Statistics Canada.But that doesn\'t mean\xa0all of them are living tax-free. Most exemptions\xa0on income, sales and property tax apply only to status Indians living or working on reserves — or both. In 2011, less than half of all registered status Indians, or about 314,000 people, lived on reserve, according to Statistics Canada.""It is definitely a myth,"" says Chief Darcy Bear of the notion that aboriginal people don\'t pay taxes.What\'s more, about\xa022 per cent of working-age\xa0status Indians living on reserves are unemployed and have no employment income, according to 2011 figures from Statistics Canada, which\xa0defines working age as 25-64. (It is unclear how many employed people living on reserves also work\xa0there.)Anyone not eligible to be or not registered as a status Indian follows the same tax rules as all other Canadians.\xa0\u200bIn 2011, that amounted to about 55 per cent of the\xa01.4 million aboriginal people\xa0in Canada.\xa0Inuit and\xa0Métis\xa0people are also excluded from the Indian Register and are regular taxpayers.Section 87 of the Indian Act exempts the ""personal property"" of status Indians from taxation.\xa0This includes:When\xa0status Indians purchase goods on a reserve, they also often do not pay GST or HST. If they buy something off reserve\xa0but have it delivered to the reserve, the GST and HST exemption still applies. Status Indians living on remote reserves may be allowed to get the\xa0GST and HST exemption for goods they bring back to the reserve.Some provinces allow partial HST rebates for certain goods purchased off reserves.But Bear points out that often, it simply doesn\'t make\xa0financial sense to use the sales tax\xa0exemptions.There are no large shopping centres on Whitecap Dakota First Nation, for example, so residents often travel about 20 minutes into downtown Saskatoon to shop, he says. Buying something like a pair of jeans and paying for delivery will cost residents more than opting to pay the\xa0GST/HST and bringing the item back themselves.""We\'re paying tax all the time,"" he said.A status Indian living\xa0and working on a reserve is ""a slam dunk"" for tax exemption, says Bruce Hurst, a certified general accountant with RHN, an accounting firm that\xa0works with First Nations in B.C.But\xa0individuals and businesses who have more complicated situations and might qualify for tax exemption must\xa0determine how much of their income-earning activity\xa0happens on reserve and how much happens elsewhere.""Oftentimes, that\'s a bit of a grey area,"" said Hurst.The Canada Revenue Agency\xa0outlines several factors used to determine whether businesses and self-employed individuals can be tax exempt, including:Taxes on income earned by fishermen, for example,\xa0can be tricky, says Hurst, because where individuals fish and where they sell their catch is important, but they frequently work in waters that can be difficult to classify.""If that\'s their traditional fishing grounds, there\'s a possibility that, that would be considered to be exempt,"" he said.If some business activities occur on reserve and some off reserve, the tax exemption for income and business expenses may be prorated.Status Indians and\xa0businesses are also not exempt from paying excise taxes and duties on certain manufactured products. For example, Grand River Enterprises, a company making cigarettes on Six Nations of the Grand River land near Brantford, Ont.,\xa0pays about $160 million annually in excise duties, said\xa0Jules.Status Indians or couples with tax-exempt income may still be eligible for some of the same tax credits and benefits as taxpayers.In order to qualify for benefits such as\xa0the Canada Child Tax Benefit, tax-exempt individuals must still file a tax return, Hurst said,\xa0and declare their income under a section labelled: ""Indian (exempt income) — Employment.""Hurst\xa0said\xa0one of his\xa0First Nations clients\xa0earns tax-exempt income on reserve\xa0but is married to a non-First Nations man who works off reserve. On their income tax return, they declare his income for tax purposes\xa0but include her income in the special section.""It might be exempt income for tax purposes, but it would be classified as working income for the purpose of calculating all these other tax credits,"" Hurst said.The CRA points out that\xa0the\xa0Supreme Court of Canada emphasized\xa0in a 1990 decision\xa0that tax exemption for First Nations serves in part to protect\xa0aboriginal land and ""to make sure tax does not erode the use of Indian property on reserves.""It is not meant""to help remedy the economically disadvantaged position of aboriginal people in Canada or bring economic benefits to them,"" the CRA says, paraphrasing the decision known as\xa0Mitchell\xa0vs.\xa0Peguis Indian Band.The tax exemptions on property,\xa0in particular\xa0—\xa0which, the court points out,\xa0de facto date\xa0back to the Royal Proclamation of 1763\xa0— exist ""so that lands couldn\'t be lost by Indian people ... through\xa0forfeitures, tax sales, those kinds of things,"" Jules said.When it comes to income, the exemption is also owing in part to the fact that, historically, aboriginal people were considered wards of the state.""Income taxes didn\'t apply because, generally, you don\'t tax people\xa0that\xa0are not your citizens,"" Jules said.\xa0Just because some status Indians don\'t pay federal and provincial income taxes\xa0doesn\'t mean they pay zero tax. There are more than\xa0600 bands in Canada, and some reserves levy their own taxes on residents.Bear says those communities are following in the tradition of the ""sharing model"" that\'s always been a part of First Nations culture.\xa0""If your best hunter killed 10 buffalo, he doesn\'t eat 10 buffalo himself. He shares with the whole community,"" he said.Not only hunters participated in this kind of exchange — everybody had a gift to contribute, Bears says, such as making clothing or sharing their wisdom.The First Nations Tax Commission helps band governments develop property tax regimes. More than 150 First Nations have implemented property taxes on reserves, bringing in $70 million annually, according to the FNTC.\xa0First Nations use the revenue to build schools,\xa0roads and other infrastructure, says Jules, and to help pay for elder care and education.The Whitecap Dakota First Nation has charged a property tax for about a decade, says Bear. Some of the revenue\xa0pays for language and culture programs. Bear says it\'s important for the First Nation to generate income so it can invest in its No. 1 resource: its people.Eight reserves charge a five per cent First Nations sales tax on alcohol, fuel and/or tobacco bought on their land, according to the CRA.\xa0Twenty-six First Nations, including Whitecap Dakota First Nation,\xa0have implemented a five per cent First Nations goods and services tax on\xa0products bought on reserves.Fourteen self-governing aboriginal communities, which have entered into agreements with the federal\xa0government to no longer be governed by the Indian Act, have imposed a First Nations personal income tax, generating about $18 million annually, according to the CRA.""In a lot of cases, you know, the First Nations individuals are now becoming mainstream taxpayers as a result,"" said Hurst.To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada\'s online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

In some locales, wild rice and cranberries might have been\xa0served, and on the coasts and in the far north seafood would have\xa0been a staple.As they were passed from generation to generation, they became\xa0""traditional,"" he says, explaining this sharing of knowledge and\xa0foods is very much in the spirit of First Nations culture.He is a member of the Xaxli\'p First Nation in British Columbia,\xa0but ""I grew up as an urban native (in Toronto) so I had to learn my\xa0culture."" He remembers as a boy trying to take notes as an elder\xa0shared stories and being admonished by an aunt to put the pencil and\xa0paper away. ""You should be listening,"" she said.""Later on I realized (what she meant was) that the stories\xa0shared with you are given to you to share. They\'re not given to you\xa0to keep. That was one of the things that really stuck in my head. So\xa0a recipe I give you, it\'s not a secret recipe. It\'s to share. You\'re\xa0going to take it and add your own things to it and share it with\xa0other people and so on. It stays alive that way.""Of course, the recipes and cooking methods have changed.""They would dig out pits in the ground and smoulder rocks over\xa0the fire. Then they would put some type of green leaves over top and\xa0just keep layering it with food. Whatever took the longest to cook\xa0went on the bottom, so there would be a lot of stuff like deer and\xa0salmon. Root vegetables and potatoes would be closer to the top. It\xa0would be an all-day cooking process,"" she says and if many people\xa0were to be fed, the pit could be huge.This obviously isn\'t practical for the two locations of the\xa0Kekuli Cafe she and her husband own in B.C. But her menu is\xa0definitely based on aboriginal traditions, she says.Her specialty is bannock, a flat or biscuit-type of bread and a\xa0staple of aboriginal cuisine that can be baked or cooked in a frying\xa0pan. There\'s some suggestion it was adapted from Scottish settlers.It\'s featured in breakfast fare, as bannock burgers and sandwiches\xa0and she even offers a berry-bannock pudding for dessert.When she opened her first cafe in Westbank in 2009, ""It was kind\xa0of scary,"" she says. She knew of only one other aboriginal\xa0restaurant, a high-end spot in Vancouver that has closed, although a\xa0few more have opened since.""I didn\'t know what to tell people when they asked, \'What kind\xa0of food do you serve?\' \'Well, we serve First Nations food.\' \'Well,\xa0what is that?\'""The bannock was a theme. We had salmon, venison, buffalo, the\xa0classics, burgers and fries. We make all our own sauces and\xa0vinaigrettes so we really try to have an aboriginal twist to our\xa0foods.""Her success with both natives and non-natives allowed her to open\xa0a second location in Merritt in August.\xa0Wolfman sees a huge resurgence of interest in aboriginal food\xa0reflected in the ""eat local"" and ""100-mile diet"" movements.\xa0Historically, natives may have had no choice, but now large numbers of Canadians see the wisdom, both economically and in terms of taste\xa0and freshness, of eating only locally grown and produced food, he\xa0says.While there may not be a proliferation of restaurants with exclusively aboriginal-themed menus, more and more high-end establishments are introducing dishes featuring typically aboriginal\xa0ingredients. ""They\'re serving bison, arctic char, those sort of\xa0things. The more people are aware of foods, the greater the demand\xa0will become.""For the man who calls his cooking ""aboriginal fusion:\xa0traditional foods with a modern twist,"" it\'s fine if those dishes are updated.""What I do is respecting and understanding traditional foods but\xa0serving them in a modern way.""Bond says that on a cross-country car trip with her husband in\xa0September, ""I was thinking, \'what is Canadian food?\' Everything\xa0that is Canadian is so simplistic, simple foods from the land, like\xa0the blueberries, the maple syrup from the trees, salmon from the\xa0river.

['2018-07-12T19:05:43.179Z'],['Indigenous leaders turn down invitation to meeting of premiers'],['Janyce McGregor'],['https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/indigenous-decline-premiers-nb-1.4743246'],"['aThere\'s still a meeting scheduled for next week\xa0between Canada\'s premiers and Indigenous organizations, but it won\'t include the leaders of the Assembly of First Nations, the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami or the Métis National Council. They\'re all declining the Council of the Federation\'s invitation again this year.The three\xa0organizations cite different reasons for their absence, but the end result for the first day of the summer premiers\' meeting\xa0remains the same as it was in 2017: the conversation won\'t include the three leaders who represent the largest number of First Nations, Inuit and Métis people in Canada.New Brunswick is hosting this summer\'s meeting\xa0at Pays de la Sagouine in Bouctouche, as it takes\xa0over as the\xa0chair of the Council of the Federation.In response to a question\xa0about exactly who was expected to attend, a\xa0spokesperson for New Brunswick\'s executive council office\xa0reported that all she could say is that organizers are still receiving RSVPs and confirmations on attendance.Before last year\'s talks in Edmonton, AFN\xa0National Chief Perry Bellegarde, ITK\xa0President Natan Obed and Métis National Council President Clément Chartier\xa0called a news conference in Toronto to tell the media they would not participate.""We are not just another special interest group,"" Bellegarde\xa0said back then.Bellegarde hasn\'t changed his mind. He said in a statement to CBC\xa0News Thursday that he\'s not\xa0going again this year because there\'s been no progress in addressing his organization\'s concerns.He also criticized ""moves by premiers to minimize First Nations participation not only in meetings with premiers, but all federal-provincial-territorial ministerial level meetings.""The AFN\xa0was planning to send a regional chief to the gathering, but on Thursday that changed.Bellegarde\'s statement said ""First Nations leadership identified on the draft agenda had not been contacted and had not received invitations to date or [been] treated with appropriate protocol and respect.""A smaller meeting\xa0between the premiers and the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples (CAP) —\xa0which represents Indigenous people living off-reserve in Canada — and the Native Women\'s Association of Canada (NWAC) is expected to\xa0proceed, as it did in Edmonton.Robert Bertrand, CAP\'s national chief, will be participating in next week\'s talks. He told\xa0CBC\xa0News Thursday that it\'s not too often that NWAC and CAP get this much face-time with the premiers to discuss the problems facing off-reserve Indigenous people and he found last year\'s session valuable.He said he\xa0heard from NWAC\'s\xa0president,\xa0Francyne Joe, that she\'ll be there as well.""I find for us it\'s an excellent way of meeting the new premiers,"" he said, without speculating on why other Indigenous leaders\xa0were staying away. ""It\'s a win-win situation.""\xa0He said the group\'s agenda for the meeting\xa0includes discussions of\xa0Indigenous children in care and economic development.Explaining his reasons for skipping the meeting again this year, Chartier\xa0said the premiers ""don\'t respect the fact that the inherent right of self-government is alive and well in this country."" When the New Brunswick organizers refer to what he leads as simply a\xa0""national Indigenous organization,""\xa0they fail\xa0to recognize its status as the national government of the Métis\xa0nation, he said.""We\'re not invited as representatives of governments,"" he said.Chartier\xa0said that, as recently as last December, the outgoing chair of the Council of the Federation — Alberta Premier Rachel Notley — wrote a letter trying to direct\xa0the federal government in how it deals with his group, something he described as an act of\xa0""marginalization and non-recognition of our representativity of our nations and peoples.""At issue\xa0is whether there are two levels of government in Canada\xa0— federal and provincial\xa0— or three, including First Nations, Inuit and Métis\xa0representation.The leaders of the Assembly of First Nations, the Inuit\xa0Tapiriit\xa0Kanatami\xa0and the\xa0Métis\xa0National Council say they don\'t appreciate being invited to meet alongside\xa0other organizations that represent Indigenous people but are not recognized governments of\xa0sovereign nations.Chartier said he\'s heard that the Women of the Métis\xa0Nation also were\xa0invited this year — a group not recognized as having the same status as the\xa0Métis\xa0National Council.""Because nothing has changed, the Metis Nation will not be accepting the invitation to attend,"" he said.Bellegarde\xa0is up for re-election when the AFN\xa0gathers later this month.In a\xa0pre-election period, the national chief relinquishes some administrative and financial authority and must limit his use of resources to AFN\xa0business — but meeting with provincial and territorial premiers is part of the job of the national chief.For its part,\xa0ITK\xa0has\xa0a\xa0scheduling conflict next week.The 13th\xa0general assembly of the Inuit Circumpolar Council takes place in Utqiagvik, Alaska July 16-19. The\xa0meeting is held\xa0once\xa0every four years, and elections are being held at this gathering as well.ITK\'s president,\xa0Obed,\xa0will\xa0lead\xa0Canada\'s delegation in Alaska. Any potential alternates that could have been sent to meet with the premiers in his place will also be in Alaska, ITK\xa0spokesperson Erin Brandt Filliter told CBC\xa0News.Filliter also suggested to CBC\xa0that, for ITK, last year\'s absence was motivated by the way the agenda was set for the talks, with the premiers seen as telling the Indigenous organizations what would be up for discussion.Jared Wesley, a University of Alberta professor who studies the Council of the Federation, disagrees with the characterization of the premiers\' agenda-setting as top-down. It\'s consensus-based, he said.Some provinces were upset by what happened\xa0last year because they\'d spent months negotiating an agenda they believed everyone was happy with, he wrote\xa0CBC\xa0News Wednesday.Chartier\xa0read the invitation\xa0the Métis\xa0National Council received from Gallant\'s office aloud during his interview with CBC\xa0News. It contained what he called ""sloppy penmanship"": the letter invited Chartier to meet with his own organization, the Métis National Council, among a list of invitees\xa0that did not include the AFN.It\xa0might have been a\xa0copying and pasting error, but considering it\'s an official letter, he wasn\'t impressed.""My officials will be in contact with your organization to seek your input on the development of the agenda for our discussion,"" Chartier\xa0said, reading more from the invitation. In fact, he said, no one contacted his office.Chartier\xa0is a veteran of premiers\xa0meetings, dating back over a decade. He said he\'s seen few\xa0results coming from them, aside from their past success in getting the premiers to call for a national inquiry on missing and murdered Indigenous women\xa0— something he called a ""no-brainer.""There was a time when premiers and Indigenous leaders made common cause against what they saw as\xa0an unsympathetic federal Conservative government led by Stephen Harper, he said.But the Métis, he said,\xa0are happier\xa0with the progress they\'ve seen on their issues through working directly with Justin Trudeau\'s Liberal government.Issues around Métis membership criteria and the recognition of their rights remain, but Chartier\xa0said\xa0a national meeting is less relevant to him than a gathering of just the Western premiers who represent the\xa0jurisdictions across his people\'s homeland.The larger discussions only work well for discussing broad principles like child welfare, he said.""There really\xa0wasn\'t much that came out of these [past premiers] meetings other than talk,"" he said.\xa0As for the question of why the premiers aren\'t open to changing the format of the talks, or limiting who\'s\xa0invited, Chartier\xa0said he\xa0believes that\'s rooted in a possible\xa0threat to the premiers\' self-interest.""The more Indigenous governments are recognized and the more transfer payments go directly to Indigenous governments, perhaps they fear they\'re going to be losing some of their transfer payments,"" he said.No official boycott was co-ordinated between the three groups this time, he said, although they do speak informally on a regular basis.""It\'s not a boycott. I just didn\'t accept the invitation.""Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

Water is retrieved from communal standpipes or delivered to households by truck.The CBC News series\xa0The Big Fix\xa0examines Canada\'s crumbling infrastructure and what\'s needed to repair it.

Meanwhile, the\xa0price of materials and transportation to get them to the remote fly-in community rises, and by the time the money does become available, it doesn\'t cover the full cost of the original project.""Every year, costs go up and, somehow, we tend to lose out,"" Knott said. ""They do less than what was projected.""Manitoba reserves have some of the worst water problems in the country: six per cent of homes on reserves in that province have no water service at all.\xa0Recent attention\xa0from\xa0local media\xa0and a Liberal motion in the House of Commons prompted Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Duncan to announce that the\xa0government would spend $5.5 million\xa0to help improve infrastructure in the four communities that make up the Island Lake First Nations, including Wasagamack.First Nations are responsible for 20 per cent of the costs of maintaining water and sewer systems, and the federal government funds the rest. But in many instances, the federal allocations are not enough to ensure a fully functioning water and sewage system that provides clean, safe water to all homes on reserve.Even when water is available, it is often inadequately treated or compromised by corroded pipes and aging distribution systems. More than 120 First Nations communities were under a Health Canada\xa0water advisory as of Oct. 31.Attawapiskat, a Cree community on James Bay\xa0in northern Ontario, has been wanting to replace its degraded intake system, which draws water from a small local lake to the community\'s treatment plant, for\xa010 years but hasn\'t been able to afford to do so and recently had to suspend water service.""Right now, people have to pick up water,"" said Chief Theresa Spence. ""They can\'t use their water tap, because\xa0[the water]\xa0has a different taste to it.""The combination of improper sanitation and bad water quality can lead to a number of health problems, including skin rashes and infections, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal illnesses. It also means infections take longer to heal and\xa0infectious diseases spread\xa0more easily.The government says that since 2006 it has spent $2.5 billion on water and wastewater services in First Nations communities, including commitments made through to 2013.""On an annual basis, the investment is significant, so I wouldn\'t agree that the funding has been insufficient,"" said Gail Mitchell, director-general for community infrastructure at Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC).""I would agree that it\'s always hard to manage and balance the many priorities that governments face, so that\'s why, when it comes to infrastructure, long-term planning is so key, and we do support communities in developing five-year plans.""Over the years, successive governments have vowed to improve water quality and access on reserves in the wake of embarrassing crises such as the\xa02005 E. coli outbreak\xa0in\xa0Kashechewan, which had to have more than 1,000 residents\xa0airlifted out of the northern Ontario reserve\xa0after\xa0they became sick from high levels of the bacteria in their drinking water\xa0and developed skin problems from the excessive\xa0amount of chlorine used to\xa0treat it.But a recent\xa0government-commissioned assessment\xa0of water and sewer services on reserves suggests many communities remain vulnerable to the health and environmental problems that result from\xa0poor water quality and inadequate sanitation.The assessment, which was released in April 2011, looked at the water and sewer systems of 571 First Nations (with a total population of 484,321 and 112,836 ""dwellings"") and evaluated their water source and how well each system was designed, operated and monitored.It categorized 39 per cent of the water systems as ""high risk,"" meaning\xa0they have ""major deficiencies"" that pose a high risk to water quality and could lead to potential health and safety or environmental concerns. Thirty-four per cent were assessed as posing medium risk to the quality of water and health and having deficiencies that ""should be corrected to avoid future problems.""More than half of water systems on B.C. reserves and 46 per cent of those on Ontario reserves were considered high risk. Ontario also had the highest percentage (36 per cent) of sewage systems deemed high risk.[IMAGEGALLERY galleryid=1541 size=small]Although the AANDC\'s protocol on drinking water on reserves is based on provincial standards, there is no regulatory enforcement mechanism to ensure those standards are being met. First Nations are responsible for monitoring water quality in co-operation with Health Canada. But the 2011 auditor general\'s report found that AANDC and Health Canada ""do not ensure that drinking water is tested on a regular basis.""Listen to CBC Radio\'s Karen Pauls report on life on\xa0two Manitoba reserves:The water problems on the Garden Hill First Nation have caught the attention of the Mennonite Central Committee, which usually works in developing countries.\xa0LISTEN\xa0Three generations of the Harper family live in a home on the Wasagamack reserve\xa0with no running water\xa0and a slop pail\xa0for a toilet.\xa0LISTENThe government did introduce a water standards bill\xa0for reserves last year, but it died on the order paper and has not yet been reintroduced. Even when the bill does resurface, it will likely be some time before it takes effect.The Assembly of First Nations (AFN)\xa0opposed the first draft\xa0of the bill, which it said would give the federal government too much power to unilaterally impose the legislation and override treaty rights and First Nations bylaws.""One of the principal issues is not only the content of what needs to be done but how it needs to be done,"" said AFN National Chief Shawn Atleo. ""Bringing First Nations as full partners to designing solutions is not simply accomplished by a junior bureaucrat phoning up a chief and saying, \'You know, we have a solution for you, by the way; it\'s just a matter of you agreeing with us.\' That\'s the pattern that got us in this position in the first place.""Even with a water standards act in place, the task of bringing reserves\' rudimentary water and sewer infrastructure up to those standards will be a colossal job.The national assessment estimates that it would cost $846 million to bring reserve water systems in line with AANDC\'s own policies\xa0and $316 million to do the same for wastewater systems.To meet and maintain all\xa0current and future\xa0water and wastewater needs on reserves\xa0for the next 10 years would cost $4.7 billion in servicing and would require an annual operating and maintenance budget of $419 million.The\xa0Department of Aboriginal Affairs\xa0has said it will provide additional funding in 2011-12 to 15 of the communities whose water systems were categorized as high risk in the national assessment and upgrade another 57 water systems by 2015-16.It\'s not always practical to hook every resident up to a water main in communities that are remote like Wasagamack or ones with low population density, and often, even when a water main is available nearby, many residents can\'t afford to pay to be hooked up to it.According to the assessment, 72 per cent of homes on reserve have piped water service; 13.5 per cent are on truck delivery; 13 per cent have individual wells; and 1.5 per cent have no service. For wastewater, 54 per cent are piped; eight per cent are on truck haul; 36 per cent have individual wastewater systems; and 2 per cent have no service.""Ultimately, First Nations leadership and First Nations communities are making decisions about planning for the delivery of water services to their members, and they\'re working with the budgets they have available and making choices,"" Mitchell said.""So, there\'s certainly no question that there\'s a range of services out there that communities are providing, and the issue of infrastructure planning is, I think, at the heart of it.""Treatment plants on reserve are often aging, deficient or operating beyond capacity, and their lifespan is much shorter than it should be.""Inadequate operation and maintenance practices or improper operation by poorly equipped technicians have resulted in premature replacement of equipment or system components, and service interruptions,"" the water assessment found.It went on to note that many communities rely on outdated treatment technology and old guidelines, and are unable to identify contaminants that have long been treated in other parts of Canada.A lack of plans to protect water sources is also a contributing factor to poor water quality, although\xa0the assessment notes that First Nations can\'t tackle this problem alone, since\xa0in many cases\xa0the sources of contamination originate off reserve.One of the primary obstacles that many First Nations face in trying to maintain a well-functioning water and sewage treatment system is a shortage of technicians who are adequately trained to do the necessary monitoring of water quality.""Sixty per cent of risk relates to who\'s operating those systems —\xa0how they\'re doing it and the kinds of record keeping and processes that they have in place,"" said Mitchell.Only 54 per cent of water and 49 per cent of wastewater systems on reserve have a fully certified primary operator, the assessment found. In the most remote communities, only 26 per cent of systems meet operator requirements.The government spends\xa0$10 million\xa0a year\xa0to train First Nations members how to operate their water and sewage systems\xa0through its Circuit Rider Training Program. But the demand for such\xa0expertise still outstrips supply, and many First Nations end up having to hire experts from outside the community to run their treatment plants.Such is the case in\xa0Kashechewan, which has partially upgraded and computerized its water treatment plant since the 2005 crisis and brought in an outside company, which\xa0is subject to provincial water quality standards, to operate it.""We\'re training our own to be able to take over that responsibility,"" said Chief Jonathan Solomon. ""That\'s always been the goal. I\'m hoping that within a year or a year and a half or two, we will be in that situation.""Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

And the Winnipeg Jets announce that they play hockey on land formerly used by the Anishinaabe, Cree, Oji-Cree, Dakota, and Dene peoples, and the Metis Nation.These brief reminders of Canada\'s colonial history, tucked into the routines of everyday life, are meant as small acts of reconciliation.But Indigenous leaders stress that the more powerful the institution that makes the statement, the more important it is for it to be accompanied by concrete actions or it appears more as an empty gesture than a sign of respect.Niigan Sinclair, assistant professor and head of University of Manitoba\'s native studies department, does outreach work across the country. At his suggestion, the Winnipeg Jets became the first NHL team to acknowledge the colonial history of their arena, making a commitment in October to announce the traditional landholders of the area at each home game.""Making a land acknowledgment should be the most important thing Canadians do before starting any event,"" Sinclair says. ""It is a fundamental analysis of who we are, where we\'re standing, and how we should proceed.""The practice has become customary for many arts spaces as well. Small theatres, including Toronto\'s Buddies in Bad Times, have been starting shows with territorial acknowledgments for years. In October, Tarragon, a bigger and more established Toronto theatre with an older client base, began making land acknowledgments after a request from Brian Solomon, an actor of Anishnaabe descent who appeared in one of their shows. The response has been overwhelmingly positive, says Tarragon\'s Natasha Parsons, who recites the acknowledgment before each show.""It\'s becoming a lot more commonplace now, and the neighbourhood we\'re in, in particular, is quite rich in that history,"" she says. ""We just thought it was the right thing to start doing.""As territorial acknowledgments begin to spread beyond event and arts spaces to bigger, more powerful institutions, critics worry that the practice will become a way to pay lip service to reconciliation without actually implementing change.""It\'s becoming a formality and a checklist process,"" says Michael Etherington, cultural program manager at the Native Canadian Centre of Toronto.He suggests fewer acknowledgments, but ones developed in consultation with Indigenous groups and accompanied by more historical and cultural context. ""It\'s moving ahead faster than it should be. I think it has to be retracted a bit. Do we want to have a surface-level dialogue? Or do we want to get to the actual source of what we are advocating, as Indigenous peoples, towards truth and reconciliation?""In September 2016, the Toronto District School Board began incorporating land acknowledgments into their morning announcements. Every day, along with the national anthem, students are reminded that ""this school is situated on territories belonging to the Wendat, Anishinabek Nation, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nations, and the Metis Nation.""Duke Redbird, a community elder who suggested the change to the TDSB, says it\'s an especially important message as Canada\'s 150th anniversary celebrations approach. Canadians, particularly young people, should be reminded that ""Canada began more than 150 years ago,"" he says. ""The continent has been occupied for 12 to 15,000 years.""TDSB official Shari Schwartz-Maltz says the response from students has been unreservedly positive. ""The territorial land acknowledgment has sparked an interest in the kids to investigate further what it all means. \'Where was our school so many years ago? What does land acknowledgment mean?\' We\'ve seen actual, tangible results from that.""Rev. Cecile Fausak has been working as Reconciliation and Indigenous Justice Animator for the United Church of Canada since 2005. That means reaching out to the Church\'s 2,500 congregations to begin ""helping the church to grapple with its complicity.""Every service at her church in Athabasca, Alta., begins with a land acknowledgment, and it\'s printed in the church bulletin. Most congregants appreciate the effort, she says, although ""for non-Indigenous people, it\'s often unsettling. But that needs to happen. It creates a sort of shift in perspective — well, why are we doing this? What does that mean? And that\'s a good path of questioning to embark upon.""To Etherington, the fact that land acknowledgments happen at all is a sign that more work needs to be done.""I think if we get to the point where we have Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples having meaningful relations, the land acknowledgment would not be necessary, because that respect would have been established.""Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

The reason, they said, boiled down to one thing:\xa0self-protection.\xa0Hogue\'s mom is Polish, and she describes her dad as ""old-fashioned\xa0Métis.""Because of her skin and hair colour, she says she hasn\'t experienced discrimination like other Indigenous people. The same cannot be said for her brother. ""When my brother was young, he was darker than I am. He would be teased as being a \'stupid Indian,\'"" recalls Hogue.""That really affected me.""Experiences like that\xa0prompted Hogue\'s family to tell people\xa0they were not Indigenous, and she\xa0remembers being told to tell people the family was French.\xa0Otherwise, she was told, ""you would face a lot of hardship.""Hogue said one of the stories that sticks out in her memory is about\xa0her grandmother telling her aunties to\xa0pick the colours of their clothing carefully\xa0""so they wouldn\'t look dark.""Memories like that have troubled her. ""It\'s been hard to be Indigenous in this land. In some ways, that has come out in terms of protection. That protection has looked like — not sharing who you are with other people,"" said Hogue.These days, she feels like\xa0she no longer has to hide that she is of Métis ancestry. When she thinks about why she\'s\xa0proud to be Indigenous, she says it\'s ""because my ancestors are part of this land, and are connected to this land.""Although other members of Hogue\'s family are all card-carrying members of the Manitoba Metis Federation, she hasn\'t applied for membership herself.""I didn\'t want to have a political organization be the reason I held identity,"" she explained.As she gets older, Hogue is determined to learn more and build a stronger connection to her culture.\xa0""It\'s good to be clear about who we are, and be connected to who we are.""A status Indian from Rolling River\xa0First Nation, Man., Bird identifies as both First Nations and African. Growing up, her father wasn\'t around much, which meant that she had a stronger connection to her mother\'s Anishinabe\xa0family.With the exception of going back to her community to attend funerals, Bird spent the majority of her youth in Winnipeg\'s West End, growing up with a large family that included relatives who also have African ancestry.\xa0""My world has always been both,"" she said.Bird said she feels lucky, because she ""was fortunate enough to be raised in a family\xa0where not only did I see my \'full-blooded\' cousins, but I also got to see cousins who looked like me."" Bird now has a\xa0strong sense of pride in both identities\xa0— but\xa0there were times in her life\xa0when the fear of racial discrimination\xa0meant she\xa0held back on telling people that she was Indigenous. ""People would not even be friends with me if they found out I was half-Native,"" said Bird. ""There were many situations where I\'ve been lucky that I appeared as a black woman.""Those times didn\'t last, however, and Bird now revels in the uniqueness of her mixed family.With a laugh, she remembers being at a family wedding and seeing ""a bunch of black people jigging.""Bird is a new author, and talked about taking a friend to her book launch. She remembers giving\xa0a warning before the event.""I told my friend,\xa0\'You\'re going to walk in and it\'s going to sound like there are Aboriginal women sitting in that room and you\'re going to walk closer in and you\'re going to see that it\'s black women,\'"" said Bird.""You\'re going to see black women with the most \'rez\' accents ever.

He was born in Vietnam and moved to Canada when he was was 10 years old.

A formal announcement with the province was scheduled for 11 a.m. MT today.The community\xa0is small, both in terms of its size and its population. Not all of its 97 members live in the area, a 40-minute drive north from Alberta\'s oilsands developments in Fort McMurray. But it\'s now a pioneer in Métis history.""The message … is that as we go over the future for Métis developments and Métis land claims all over the Prairies, we can say that Métis land ownership is not incompatible with the ownership of other interest groups,"" Dwayne Roth, a lawyer who played a key role in negotiations, said.Felix Faichney, who grew up in the Fort McKay community, says the idea that he and the rest of its members would one day own the land they call home seemed a distant dream.""It wasn\'t ours. We didn\'t have the freedom to do with our land what we wanted,"" Faichney, 20, the board director of the Fort McKay Métis Community, said as he surveyed some of the backwoods that will eventually\xa0be torn down to make way for housing.For years, Roth said, the Fort McKay Métis hesitated to develop the land, as they were leasing it from the province.""To invest that kind of development infrastructure into something you don\'t own just didn\'t make economic sense.""Now, the construction equipment and fences that sit in a barren field should soon be transformed into a community pavilion.Across the street, an advertisement billboard should soon be replaced by the gas station, car wash and fast-food restaurant it currently promotes.The community also has plans for a healing lodge, a spray park and an administrative centre.For the community\'s president, Ron Quintal, this has\xa0all been long in the making. He said he was first elected to office in 2005 with a mandate to acquire the land in question. The community had previously purchased\xa0120 acres (about 50 hectares) in 2014, and on Wednesday, acquired\xa0the remaining 372 acres (about 150 hectares) for $1.6 million.""The work that I\'ve done for this community is to allow my sons and all the sons and daughters of the community in Fort McKay to almost have an inheritance,"" said Quintal.In 2016, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled the federal government has the same level of responsibility toward Métis people in Canada as it does toward First Nations.Quintal said the landmark decision is playing a key role in shifting how Métis are able to speak to, and negotiate with, different elected representatives across the country.""The First Nations have been able to get where they are through a recognition of treaty rights. They negotiated treaty rights years ago, and that\'s basically the platform they\'ve been able to assert themselves on,"" Quintal said.""The Métis haven\'t had that opportunity. Up until recently, recognition of Métis rights was non-existent.""But Quintal is also aware their example won\'t be the easiest one for Métis to emulate elsewhere.With its proximity to the oilsands, his community has been uniquely placed to build up the wealth to buy its land over the years. Many of its members work for companies in the industry.That\'s not the case for other Métis communities in Canada. Still, both Quintal and Roth hope Fort McKay could serve as an inspiration.""Communities that don\'t have the prosperity that we have, they can follow that model and start working with industry or whatever model it is that they have in their own backyards, to start to leverage this economic prosperity,"" Roth said. \xa0As for Felix\xa0Faichney, he is excited about what the future has in store for Fort McKay, and he wants to be there to help build it. He\'ll be leaving his own full-time job in the oilsands industry at the end of March to dedicate himself full-time to the Métis.\xa0""The youth coming up, like my son — [this purchase] creates all those opportunities for him, opportunities that I didn\'t have,"" he said, referring to two-year-old Felix Jr.Raffy BoudjikanianRaffy Boudjikanian is a national reporter with CBC in Edmonton.

In Calgary, a\xa0city contained in the traditional Treaty 7 territory of the Niitsitapi (Blackfoot Confederacy: Siksika, Kainai and Piikani), Stoney-Nakoda, and Tsuut\'ina Nations.There are no easy answers. The Indigenous experience, like with any form of belonging, is highly fluid and context-specific, meaning there are countless examples of what such cultural pluralities can look like. One thing\'s for sure. The city\'s Indigenous population, which jumped by a staggering 75 per cent between 1996 and 2006, will continue to rapidly expand in coming years. And with increasing numbers and political power, Indigenous people will have a significant impact on the identity and direction of the city.As a white settler who was born in New Zealand and has lived in every quadrant of Calgary at some time or another, I asked a few Indigenous people living in Calgary what that negotiation looks like. Each have their own experiences and complex takes. No conclusions were reached in the process. In fact, that might be the most important lesson learned.There are no conclusions about what it means to be Indigenous in Calgary. Calgary\'s Aboriginal population grew from 62 to 26,575 people between 1951 and 2006.In 2006 – the last year that census data is available \xa0—\xa0\xa0Aboriginal people made up 2.5 per cent of Calgary\'s total population. Some 56 per cent of those identified as Métis, while another 41 per cent as First Nations.Some moved to the city for jobs, others for family and even more to gain new skills and education before returning to their home territories.Steve Kootenay-Jobin, Aboriginal housing coordinator at Mount Royal University, notes that many Indigenous students who move to the city for education, encounter culture shock.Cynthia Bird, who moved from Winnipeg in 2004, says it was initially difficult to find where Indigenous people gather: ""[There]\xa0you can walk anywhere or go into any business and you see our people. That wasn\'t the case here. We found we had to look hard.""Kootenay-Jobin says the cultural integration experience can be exacerbated by challenges such as racism and housing. It\'s tough to start wrestling with complexities like belonging and identity when you don\'t have a home.Figuring out what culture and spirituality looks like in the context of a large city like Calgary is a matter of overlaying identities. Of identity formation.According to a 2012 report from the Environics Institute, 51 per cent of urban Aboriginal people in Calgary agree with the statement ""I am concerned about losing my cultural identity,"" compared to only 34 per cent of urban non-Aboriginal people.""Understanding the dynamics of a large urban centre if you\'ve never lived in one can be overwhelming,"" said\xa0Christy Morgan, the former executive director of the recently closed Calgary Urban Aboriginal Initiative.The day-to-day practice of culture and spirituality looks different for every person.Some acquire medicines like sage, sweetgrass, fungus and cedar to use in ceremony. Others attend events such as round dances, seasonal feasts and drum-making groups.Angela Gladue – a hip-hop dancer, member of the Fly Girlz dance crew and instructor at Pulse Studios – has a Cree dictionary and some language apps on her phone.She also dances fancy shawl: ""It\'s pretty much the only way, even to this day, that I connect with being First Nations,"" also noting she\'s interested in participating in a sweat lodge in the future.Some parents smudge and pray with their kids. Some attend the annual Tiny Tots Powwow organized by the Parent Link Centre and send their children to Piitoayis Family School (a K-6 CBE school that incorporates ancestral teachings and Indigenous language education).Other people dry wild game like elk and deer meat in their kitchen, or meet with elders for wisdom and advice. \xa0Returning to the land can be part of the experience.Camille Russell, a Blackfoot elder and traditional wellness counsellor at Alberta Health Services, says he\'s found that he has to return to the Blood Reserve to visit sundance grounds, sweat lodges and his father\'s piece of land.""We tend to have to go out of the city, into the nature, to get some energy,"" he says. ""I think a lot of the elders do have some place outside of town that they go to to do ceremonies or re-energize.""But there is a multiplicity of visions even within Indigenous communities of what it means to be Indigenous in the city.Communities such as reserves and Métis\xa0settlements allows governments to easily delineate who\'s ""in"" and ""out."" In cities, however, it becomes more difficult to draw such lines given the obvious geographic size, with Indigenous people living in every part of the city and working in every sector.Identity can be thought of as self generated, or bestowed. Something we use to create a sense of self, or something that other\'s tag us with. The reality is usually a mix of these ideas.Some people argue their identity is defined by their genealogical heritage: that having ancestors who are Cree, Blackfoot, Dene, Anishinaabe, Métis or Nakota is what makes one inherently Indigenous. This as opposed to certain actions or cultural practices. \xa0""We may have forgotten a lot, or it\'s been taken away, but it doesn\'t mean you\'re not an Indigenous person,"" says Christy Morgan, former executive director of Calgary Urban Aboriginal Initiative (CUAI).""That\'s a birthright regardless of how you look and whether or not you do traditional activities.""Gladue\xa0notes she\'s occasionally received flak from elders for her involvement in hip-hop.""Nobody can take that away, including non-Indigenous people who say \'Oh, you\'re so Westernized or whatever.\' The fact that I\'m alive is enough,"" she said.Others contend that ancestry isn\'t what makes one Indigenous. For such people, it\'s one\'s active participation —\xa0time, energy, a commitment to traditional forms of leadership and governance —\xa0that allows one to ""earn rights"" to the identity.""Culture and connection: these are not things you buy at a local Costco,"" quips Cowboy Smithx, filmmaker and creator of REDx Talks. ""There should be no sense of entitlement to any of these things. Individuals must earn these rights. They must earn this access that they seek.""In a similar vein, Daniel Heath Justice,\xa0chair of the University of British Columbia\'s First Nations and Indigenous Studies department,\xa0recently tweeted: ""Indigenous belonging is more than right to \'ethnic\' heritage —\xa0it\'s relationships of obligation, citizenship, acknowledgment, reciprocity.""Of course\xa0it\'s not nearly as black-and-white as such a short summary suggests. People maintain multiple perspectives at once, weaving together a form of identity that reflects both ancestry and cultural practices.Such tensions have been debated and written about for decades. They are constantly revisited, recently popping up during the ""marry out, get out"" controversy among the Kahnawake Mohawks, or the Supreme Court ruling on the federal government\'s constitutional responsibility for Métis and non-status Indians.There\'s the additional nuance that for some people, where they grew up and where their home nation is are two completely different things.Gladue, who lives in Calgary, says that when she\'s asked where she\'s from she says Frog Lake First Nation even though she\'s never lived there. In fact, she grew up three hours west, in Edmonton. This because, as she says, ""you rep your reserve."" These sorts of complexities and nuances, these self identifications, need not be problematic. They are part of an ongoing process for Indigenous peoples.But one thing uniting almost all perspectives is a profound connection and relationship with land. It\'s a concept that commentators pushing for the ""relocation"" of remote communities like Attawapiskat misunderstand or ignore.For many Indigenous people, land is the subject of a deeply reciprocal relationship that frames their entire world\xa0view, spirituality and approach to treaties and other commitments. Cultural practices, medicines, ceremonies and gatherings all revolve around it.Hence, living\xa0""in town"", can partially sever identity links.""Our responsibility to the land and to the water and to the creatures is part of our way of looking at the world,"" Sutter said. ""I think \'urban Aboriginals\' is a term in my mind that kind of means that people are cut adrift.""Some say they have found ways to bridge that sense of dislocation.As an elder, Camille Russell says it can be mitigated by returning home to practice ceremony and commune with the land, family and elders. Kootenay-Jobin, who\'s a member of Stoney Nation and grew up in the city\'s northeast, notes he\'s ""very fortunate"" to live away only an hour away from Morley reserve.Still, some Indigenous people arrive in Calgary from remote communities that don\'t allow for easy returns. Cynthia Bird, originally from Manitoba\'s Peguis First Nation, notes that ""our identity has shifted so many times from the original place"" (in 1907, the Canadian government illegally annexed the original land of the Peguis people, forcing them to relocate).That\'s where the Native Friendship Centre and organizations like the Calgary Urban Aboriginal Initiative (CUAI) have historically stepped in.Yale Belanger, associate professor of political science at University of Lethbridge and expert on the political history of First Nations people, describes such entities as an ""informal network"" that have worked extremely hard over the decades to promote community, language and ceremony. Morgan dubs CUAI as a ""311 for most of the Aboriginal community,"" linking Indigenous people new to Calgary with resources such as housing and employment.But CUAI closed at the end of 2015 as a result of unpredictable federal funding.Sutter notes the provincial allotment for each of the 20 friendship centres in Alberta did not increase for a number of years.\xa0She says the result was that\xa0many nonprofits such as friendship centres would\xa0start a program and then the funding would be discontinued, requiring the dismantling of the program.And the challenge isn\'t confined to Alberta:\xa0In May, the Comox Valley Record reported that 25 friendship centres in B.C. would\xa0need to shut down critical programs, with some having to close entirely.The\xa0Alberta government had\xa0increased the overall funding to the Alberta Native Friendship Centres Association by $50,000\xa0in 2008-09 and by\xa0$100,000\xa0in 2016-17, according to\xa0Jessica Johnson, director of communications with the provincial Ministry\xa0of\xa0Indigenous Relations.In 2016, the province increased the base amount per year per\xa0friendship centre to $31,000 from the longtime amount of $26,000, according to\xa0Nelson Mayer, executive director of the ANFCA.He said the association was ""very pleased"" the province had recognized the need to increase the base funding for the centres.Nonetheless,\xa0Belanger said tensions mount when\xa0people are competing for limited pools of resources.""That leads to not in-fighting per se between reserve people and urban Aboriginal people, but there\'s definitely tensions and identities specific to regions start to evolve with very unique characteristics,"" he adds.And this goes back to the various Indigenous identities. Some traditional demarcations are losing their significance.Russell says he meets with other elders once a month to have a pipe ceremony, debrief and share medicines. One month it will be a led by a Cree elder, the next an Ojibwe elder, the next a Blackfoot elder.""The days of \'I\'m Blackfoot\' or \'I\'m Cree\' are kind of diminished,"" he observes. ""It\'s to the point where we need to help each other to maintain whatever we have left.""Kootenay-Jobin dubs email lists and social media the ""moccasin telegraph,"" a phrase that Sioux writer Vine Deloria, Jr. popularized. It\'s a process through which news and event notifications are passed from community member to community member.Such dialogues culminate in the creation of events like the Making of Treaty 7 theatre production and the inaugural Artsdance.The latter was an elder-led gathering hosted at Mount Royal University on June 23 that included the raising of four tipis (representing the four quadrants of the city), dinner and conversations about what a full-scale Artsdance will look like next June.Smithx —\xa0director of the Iiniistsi Treaty Arts Society, which is coordinating Artsdance —\xa0suggests such events serve as beacons to other Indigenous people to let them know that they\'re not alone, and that many people in Calgary still have connections to community and culture in spite of generations of trauma, displacement and racist policies.""Our generation does these things so the next generation can still have access to them,"" he concludes.If such efforts are any indication, the next generation will indeed have access to such practices.There will be accountants, bluegrass singers, salespeople, contemporary dancers, steel workers and nurses contained in that mix. Each will develop their own understanding of what it means to be Indigenous while living in the sprawling metropolis of Calgary via ceremonies, interactions with elders, the fostering of community and the speaking of Indigenous languages.For a great resurgence is happening. It will stumble over roadblocks like racist landlords, underfunded services and geographic separation from ancestral home territories. But it will grow, adapt and innovate, just like Indigenous people always have.And it will help define the future of Calgary.Calgary at a Crossroads is CBC Calgary\'s special focus on life in our city during the downturn.

So what?\xa0Maybe you\'re excited to learn about your roots, but can you really consider yourself part of that culture?\xa0Not really, says Kim TallBear.\xa0""We construct belonging and citizenship in ways that do not consider these genetic ancestry tests. So it\'s not just a matter of what you claim, but it\'s a matter of who claims you.""TallBear is an indigenous scholar based at the University of Alberta. She\'s reacting to a particular advertisement for DNA ancestry tests, that shows a woman who learns she is ""26 percent Native American,"" and can\'t wait to learn more about her heritage. It got regular play in Canada during Major League Baseball playoffs this year.\xa0But learning about one\'s ""Native American heritage"" is not simple. For one thing, ""Native American"" is a pretty broad term: whose heritage does she learn? Inuit? Maya? Coast Salish? The tests don\'t give you that much detail.\xa0And, TallBear says, even if you chose a specific group, having some matching genetic markers from ages ago doesn\'t mean you have the lived experience to become part of that community.\xa0""People who are not actually members of indigenous community, tend to define indigeneity or Native Americanness as a racial category. Now for us, those are umbrella categories which help us talk to one another, relate to one another, but our primary sense of belonging, and identity, is our particular indigenous or tribal community. They don\'t use the word tribe up here, but in the U.S. we do, so somebody might say \'I\'m a member of the Métis Nation,\'\xa0or \'I\'m a member of this particular Cree band,\'\xa0I would say I\'m Dakota.""Belonging to particular community can mean sharing beliefs, cultural practices - and even official membership or citizenship. Not just genetic material.\xa0What about other cultures?\xa0It\'s not just ""Native American"" connections that could be hard to develop with only DNA in hand.\xa0In the United States, DNA testing has been quite popular amongst African Americans. Because of the slave trade, many African Americans do not know where their ancestors originally came from. So DNA testing has helped rebuild a history that was wiped out.\xa0But knowing what part of Africa you\'re from might leave you in the same position as someone who has found out they\'ve got Native American genes.\xa0Alondra Nelson got her DNA tested as part of her research for the book The Social Life of DNA: Race. Reparations, and Reconciliation after the Genome.\xa0""I was inferred to be related to the Bamileke people of Cameroon, and so the question then becomes \'Do people who are Bamileke in Cameroon accept me as a Cameroonian because a company\'s analysis of a few genetic markers says that that\'s true?\'\xa0Or would they say, similarly to First Nations, to be Bamileke means these things: it means you live here, you speak this way, you think about family in this way, so these things are much more complicated.""Nelson says there are other uses for DNA testing as well: for example, the tests were used to prove that current African Americans were related to slaves, in a lawsuit attempting to get reparations for the unpaid work of those slaves. It has not succeeded.Meet Kim\xa0Trujillo, the woman in the adShe plays herself in the ad, and the DNA results are hers.\xa0Trujillo\xa0says she always knew she had some Spanish, German, and Native American history, \xa0but she wanted to know more. The DNA test told her that she has more Native American markers than she thought, and that she also has some Italian/Greek heritage (Italy/Greece is one ethnicity according to Ancestry.com\'s database).To\xa0Trujillo, the DNA test was just the first step. It gave her clues to dive into\xa0genealogy\xa0research and build her family tree. She also got in touch with the ""matches"" that were recommended to her as part of the DNA test - people who have\xa0similar\xa0ancestry.""It\'s opened up the world, as family. Not just as, \'Oh, this is what I am,\' I\'m\xa0connected\xa0to these people in other states, in other countries, it\'s just been a whirlwind, it\'s been fantastic.""\xa0She says she knows there\'s more to being\xa0indigenous\xa0than just finding out you have Native American ancestry, and that she can\'t just sign up for a tribe. But, she says everything she\'s learned about her ancestry makes her feel more connected to issues like Standing Rock.\xa0The ""Cherokee great-grandmother"" style of racismIn the United States, it is common for people to claim some amount of unproven indigenous history: most often Cherokee.\xa0To Kim TallBear, there\'s a sort of racism to that, and it lines up with anyone who would attempt to claim Native American heritage based on a DNA test alone.\xa0""There is this national sort of story, and this I do see becoming more prominent in certain parts of Canada too, that you have people with no lived experience in indigenous community, they can\'t even name any indigenous family or ancestors, but they have a family myth about a Cherokee great-grandmother, or they\'re descended from Pocahontas, you get that a lot on Virginia. So I think it\'s another kind of claim to own indigeneity, to try to have a moral claim or sense of belonging on the North American continent and so that\'s the context in which these tests are so popular.""Charles Menzies agrees with that. He\'s an anthropologist at the University of British Columbia, and a member of B.C.\'s Gitxaala Nation. \xa0He says the advantage to claiming indigenous background without having lived as an indigenous person is that you can take on the sort of earthy, spiritual side of things, but not have to deal with any of the negative stereotypes:\xa0""It also sets apart\xa0recent immigrants and true, rooted, kind of Euroamerican/Indigenous citizens who have a real connection to the land, but they\'re not kind of locked in a primitive past -\xa0which is the really nasty racist connotation. All of these kind of popular imaginations imaging having some\xa0amount of indigenous background, but not so much as to be completely thwarted by the deficits.""But, in the end, Menzies chooses to see the upside.\xa0If people are excited to find out the have Native American genetic markers, he says, maybe they\'ll be more open to ending racism towards this continent\'s indigenous peoples.

The organization\'s goal would be to ""obtain benefits and programs"" similar to those available to First Nations and Inuit communities.The letter, signed by Fort Norman Métis president Richard Hardy, opens with the premise that the Mackenzie River Métis ""retain many Aboriginal rights, as a collective Indigenous entity, under the laws of Canada.""""We realized in order to deal with the effects of the Daniels decision that we need a bigger voice than what we have as the Fort Norman Métis Community,"" Hardy said in an interview with CBC News.""We\'re saying let\'s all come together and put a common voice forward.""Before the collapse of the Dene Métis land claim in the 1990s,\xa0all Métis in the Northwest Territories were represented by the Métis Nation, Hardy explained. Since then,\xa0Métis in the North Slave region are represented by the North Slave Métis alliance and Métis south of Great Slave Lake by the new Northwest Territories Métis Nation.But the Métis along the Mackenzie River from Fort Providence up to Inuvik do not belong to any collective organization, which is what Hardy is looking to change.""Hopefully, when we\'re successful, we can make an alliance with the North Slave Métis Alliance and the Métis Nation N.W.T. to put forward a common voice for Métis in the Northwest Territories to deal with the impact of the Daniels decision,"" he said.There are three primary issues Hardy says he\'s concerned about:""It\'s a hodgepodge of what\'s out there. If, and when, we succeed in convincing the federal government that we should be treated the same as the [Status] Indian and Inuit people in Canada, then those benefits will accrue to us no matter where we live in Canada then,"" he said.One example of this is the Métis health benefit plan, Hardy said. It\'s available to Métis\xa0living in the Northwest Territories, but people who leave the territory lose their eligibility, he said.""We feel this should be a national plan provided by the federal government, so no matter where we\'re living we\'ll continue to get those benefits.""It wouldn\'t make sense for the Métis people living along the Mackenzie River to join up with either of the established Métis groups, Hardy explained. That\'s because both the North Slave Métis Alliance and the Northwest Territories Métis Nation are working on land claims in a specific geographic area, while\xa0Métis groups along the Mackenzie River region are already part of settled or ongoing land claims.""We get along the Mackenzie River, we\'re\xa0part of the Sahtu claim, the Gwich\'in claim, the Fort Providence, Fort Simpson and Fort Liard Métis are part of the Dehcho process,"" Hardy said.""I don\'t see us ever coming back together under a common organization, but we can come together to make common cause on the issues that we\'ve been talking about here.""Garry Bailey, president of the Northwest Territories Métis Nation, is supportive.Bailey said\xa0it\'s important Métis are represented by people who live in the region, instead of\xa0a national organization in Ottawa.""We have different needs in our communities and nobody from Ottawa can relate to how we live here in small communities,"" Bailey said. ""It\'s totally different.""Whether there are enough Mackenzie River Métis interested in forming a collective remains to be seen.

That agreement led to what I would call\xa0a term sheet, if you could call it that.""The term sheet had a condition in it that required it to be turned into a legally binding agreement that was more extensive, more comprehensive, more fulsome, and that never happened.""Shepherd\'s statement goes against the position held by the federation, which maintains the deal was a legally binding agreement.The deal would have seen Hydro pay $67.5 million to the federation over 50 years, as a means to forestall opposition to future projects including the Minnesota-Manitoba transmission line.Premier Brian Pallister quashed the deal in March, calling the payment ""persuasion money.""Since then,\xa0the province has contended the deal was not an agreement, but instead a proposal.Manitoba Métis\xa0Federation president David Chartrand announced his intention earlier this week to take the province to court over the dispute, after a meeting on Tuesday with Shepherd and Crown Services Minister Cliff Cullen.""They are not willing to sit down and they are going to overrule Hydro, which we believe they don\'t have the legal right to do,"" Chartrand told CBC News at the time.Shepherd said the agreement between the Crown corporation and the\xa0Métis\xa0Federation laid the groundwork to form a legal agreement.""We have a sort of a two-page term sheet that the parties worked on together, and would say that we agree to the points on the term sheet. But it\'s not signed and it\'s not in legal format,"" he said.The points would have included a number of elements, including compensation, he said.""One of the key points, though, was that the agreement needed to be turned into a binding agreement before it would have any effect, and that obviously did not take place.""Chartrand\xa0released a statement Thursday afternoon saying the refusal by the Manitoba government and Hydro to recognize the agreement is another example of Crown representatives breaking promises to Indigenous people.""Once again, the Manitoba Métis\xa0community trusted and relied on the promises of the Crown only to be deceived and lied to,"" Chratrand\xa0said in the statement.\xa0Chartrand\'s statement went on to say former Hydro chair Sandy Riley called the deal an ""agreement,"" Manitoba Hydro approved it in their minutes, and an order-in-council referred to it as an ""agreement.""""It is almost comical that the premier, Minister Cullen and now president Shepherd are trying to say there was no agreement with the MMF.\xa0… Shaking hands, making commitments and board approval is, without a doubt, an agreement.""NDP MLA James Allum (Fort Garry-Riverview) said the NDP had previously understood the agreement to be legally binding, but Shepherd\'s comments don\'t change his party\'s position.\xa0""I don\'t think it changes anything in regard to what we understood an agreement between Hydro and MMF, undertaken in good faith,"" he said.Going forward, he said the premier and minister should reach out to Chartrand to ""get back to the negotiating table,"" and not let the matter proceed to court, Allum said.\xa0""This is a recognition of MMF\'s historical and constitutional position here in Manitoba,"" he said. ""Really, when you think of an agreement that was to run for several decades, the price was actually a very good arrangement and allowed us to do the export to the United States that could only help Hydro\'s bottom line.""A spokesperson for the Progressive Conservative government said Manitoba agrees with Shepherd\'s analysis.""Our government has been clear from the start: this was a non-binding proposal, not an agreement,"" a spokesperson wrote in an email to CBC News.""On this matter, we are in agreement with Manitoba Hydro. We disagree with the MMF\'s position, and they have indicated they will be taking this matter to court without exploring any other avenues of resolution.""Crown Services Minister Cullen was not at the committee meeting Wednesday.

The ongoing rift in the national fabric that s. 31 was adopted to cure remains unremedied,"" they wrote.""The unfinished business of reconciliation of the Métis people with Canadian sovereignty is a matter of national and constitutional import,"" the ruling says.Justices Marshall Rothstein and Michael Moldaver dissented from the majority view.The ruling ends three decades of legal challenges brought by the\xa0Métis against the federal government.Friday\'s decision has not ordered any particular remedies, but it could open the door to land claim negotiations or talks toward other forms of compensation from the federal government.\xa0The Métis argued that Ottawa reneged on its promises under the Manitoba Act, which\xa0created the province and brought it into Confederation.The Manitoba Act, made in 1870, promised to set aside 5,565 square kilometres of land for 7,000 children of the Red River Métis. That land includes what is now the city of Winnipeg.The land transfer to the Métis outlined in the Act was to be a ""concrete measure"" to\xa0reconcile with the Métis community, the ruling agrees, calling\xa0its ""prompt and equitable implementation... fundamental.""The land grants were meant to give the Métis a head start in the race for land in the new province, and that meant the grants had to be made while a head start was still possible, the justices wrote.\xa0""Everyone concerned understood that a wave of settlement from Europe and Canada to the east would soon sweep over the province.""The land deal was made in order to settle the Red River resistance, which was fought by Métis\xa0struggling to hold onto their land amid growing white settlements.However, it took 15 years for the lands to be completely distributed, while the Métis\xa0faced hostility from large numbers of incoming settlers.The federal government ultimately distributed the land through a random lottery, destroying the dream of a Métis homeland.""Section 31 conferred land rights on yet-to-be-identified individuals\xa0– the Métis children,"" the ruling says. ""Yet the record leaves no doubt that it was a promise made to the Métis people collectively, in recognition of their distinct community. The honour of the Crown is thus engaged here.""In 2010, the Manitoba Court of Appeal upheld a lower court ruling that found the federal government did not violate its duty to the Métis.The case then went to the Supreme Court of Canada, where lawyers for both sides presented their arguments in December 2011.The Métis federation requested a declaration that the constitutional agreement was not upheld.Federal lawyers argued that the case should be thrown out because it is more than a century old. They also\xa0said Ottawa didn\'t actually violate its side of the agreement.Manitoba Métis Federation President David Chartrand said the ruling provides the vindication the MMF has been fighting for for years. He said he had been fielding emotional phone calls all morning.""Such pride at home right now, and tears are being shed. They’re crying and they’re phoning,"" Chartrand said.""They can’t even talk on the phone properly because there’s so much joy at home right now.""Chartrand said it is now time for the\xa0group to sit down and negotiate with the government of Canada. He said they have no interest in land but believes they should be compensated for what they have lost.\xa0""Our country did not give us any kind of credence and respect and felt they just could take whatever they wanted, and today our justice system is saying, ‘No, you can’t. You were wrong. Now fix it,’"" said Chartrand.Winnipegger John Morrisseau is a descendant of the original Red River settlers. He said the ruling not only helps right a historical wrong but makes him optimistic for the future of government-Métis relations.""It’s kind of put a different turn to it. So now, the government’s going to have to look at us a little different when we go to the table to negotiate,"" said Morrisseau.Chartrand said the negotiations are long overdue and\xa0added insight from Louis Riel, who\xa0spoke of the relationship between the federal government and the Métis during the Red River resistance.""He said there were two societies with treaty together. One was small but in its smallness had its rights. The other was great but in its greatness had no greater rights than the rights of the small. You know, how more fitting can that be today?""Manitoba historian Philippe Mailhot studied the 1870 negotiations between the Métis and the federal government and said he\'s pleased with the ruling.""My reaction is extremely positive because what was said to the delegation from the Red River Settlement in terms of the distribution of land was not what actually happened,"" said Mailhot.Karen Busby, a professor of law at the University of Manitoba, was shocked by the decision, which she says will have major implications.""This is an absolutely groundbreaking decision,"" said Busby.""The Manitoba Métis Federation and the individual plaintiffs lost on every point at the lower courts, and now, before the Supreme Court of Canada they’ve won on the most important point.""MP Jean Crowder is the NDP’s aboriginal affairs critic. In a statement issued Friday afternoon, she said it was regrettable the federal government did not negotiate a settlement on the issue before the ruling was handed down.Crowder said the federal government must now negotiate with the Métis in ""good faith.""Chartrand said after 140 years of waiting, a prompt response from the federal government is necessary.""I think the onus is on Canada now to do the right thing now, quickly,"" he said.

The air vibrates with the low rumbling of a dozen idling 18-wheelers burning fuel.For Chief Patricia Bernard of the Madawaska Maliseet First Nation, that\'s the sound of money. The big rigs have 600-plus litre tanks\xa0—\xa0and the Indigenous-owned\xa0gas bar\xa0is a popular spot to\xa0fill up before truckers hit the\xa0Quebec border.\xa0""See all those?"" Bernard said. ""Every time one of those big trucks fills up, that\'s a thousand dollars.""Gas is just a small fraction of the revenue-generating potential at the Grey Rock Power Centre.The retail centre, owned by the Edmundston-area First Nation, is a red-hot piece of real estate, right on New Brunswick\'s\xa0 border with Maine and Quebec, with up to 15,200 vehicles passing by daily on the Trans-Canada Highway.Giant roadside signs advertise gaming at the Grey Rock Casino, fast-food restaurants, a smoke shop, and a Ford dealership.A decade ago, the entire 28-hectare\xa0hillside was ""a forest,"" said Joanna Bernard, Patricia\'s sister and CEO of the Madawaska Maliseet Economic Development Corp.The Madawaska Maliseet First Nation bills itself as ""one of the most prosperous and thriving communities in New Brunswick today.""With a population of just\xa0547 — 198\xa0live on the reserve — the First Nation is home to multiple million-dollar businesses, and almost everyone who can work has a job.In 2017, the band distributed more than $3 million to band members on a per capita basis. (Compare that with the Province of New Brunswick, which in 2017 had a net debt\xa0 \xa0\xa0per capita of $18,217.)This week, the First Nation announced it will become the first reserve in New Brunswick to become a licensed producer of cannabis.How a tiny Wolastoqiyik community ended up on such a progressive path is a story of patience, reclaimed land, tax agreements and savvy leadership.Chief Bernard, who is also the First Nation\'s legal\xa0governance adviser, comes from a line of strong women.Her mother, Margaret Elizabeth DiMaggio, married Stewart Bernard of the\xa0Madawaska\xa0First Nation. In 1985, Margaret was the first woman and the first non-native person to be elected Madawaska chief. She served from 1985 to 1987, opening the door for other women to enter office — including her two daughters.\xa0Patricia\'s older sister, Joanna Bernard, was elected chief in 2003. In 2013, she was inducted into the Order of New Brunswick for her efforts to ensure the prosperity of the First Nation.The First Nation\'s senior leadership is entirely made up of women: chief Patricia Bernard, plus councillors Diane Pelletier and Donna Wallace-Bourgeault.""Since 2007, it\'s been all women, every term,"" said Patricia Bernard.""This community is very progressive.""Land, according to Bernard, is ""everything"" in Madawaska.For generations, said former chief John Wallace, a resident for 83 years, outside companies and settlers saw\xa0Indigenous land as free for the taking.""If they didn\'t want anything on their land, they would shove it down on the Indian reserve,"" Wallace said. ""Garbage dump for all the city. Pipeline. Two-lane highway. Railroad tracks. You name it.""The first step to securing the band\'s future, Patricia Bernard said, was seeking payment for the tangle of power lines, pipelines and highways built on Maliseet land without permission.\xa0In the late 1800s, Canadian Pacific Railway used about about three hectares of reserve land to build a rail line from Woodstock to Edmundston. After Canadian Pacific abandoned the land in 1971, Fraser Papers Inc. used it to build a pipeline to carry liquid pulp mill effluent, which the mill left above ground, creating\xa0a hazardous barrier across the community.\xa0After an unsuccessful attempt\xa0to sue Fraser and\xa0CP, the claim was finally accepted by the federal government for negotiations in May 2004. In 2008, Ottawa\xa0paid Madawaska $5.7 million for failing to protect its interest in the reserve. The community reached an agreement with Fraser to keep operating the pipeline underground.""I was expecting I was going to be happy if we got our million dollars,"" said Joanna Bernard, who negotiated the claim.Half the $5.7 million settlement was invested in the Grey Rock Power Centre. The other half was distributed to band members. But the reserve still needed a way to divert highway traffic onto the reserve.""There were no ramps to get off and onto the reserve through the Trans-Canada,"" Patricia Bernard said. The province refused to build the ramps, citing\xa0cost. \xa0The First Nation then took the province to negotiating school\xa0—\xa0refusing to take ""no"" for an answer.""Unfortunately, we had to play hardball,"" Bernard said. They came back to the province with proof Edmundston\'s high school, Cité des Jeunes A.-M.-Sormany, had been partially built on reserve land.""We negotiated that we would surrender the land around the high school and surrender the land for the ramps,"" Bernard said.The province built the ramps and gave the First Nation an additional 12 hectares.In November 2017, Madawaska also ratified a\xa0Land Code transferring the governance authority over its lands and resources from Indigenous and Northern Affairs back to the community —\xa0the first First Nation in New Brunswick to do so.The biggest financial achievement\xa0for Madawaska is yet to come.In 1996, Bernard was a 22-year-old education student at UNB, scrolling\xa0through old microfilm for an independent study on her community. Looking at old records, she discovered a 1787 map of the reserve that seemed to contain a shocking revelation.\xa0She ""couldn\'t believe it,"" she said, when she saw that her ancestors\' land covered what is now all of modern-day\xa0Edmundston. Madawaska territory, according to the map, originally measured 3,800 acres, or about 1,538 hectares, compared to the 700 acres, or about 183 hectares, it covers now.Twenty years after first seeing the map, after years of struggle, paperwork, being told the claim was worthless, and\xa0lawyers\' arguments on both sides,\xa0a claim for about 2,000 of those acres (about 809 hectares) was finally declared valid by Canada\'s Specific Claims Tribunal.Canada and Madawaska agreed to negotiate the\xa0claim outside the tribunal, which means Madawaska could receive in excess of $150 million in compensation.""Negotiating outside the tribunal … provides the First Nation\xa0the benefit of getting the replacement lands, and there is no $150 million\xa0cap if the claim is worth more than that,"" Bernard said.\xa0The land claim is ""much, much bigger,"" than any claim the First Nation has dealt with before, said Bernard, who hopes the two sides will agree on a settlement amount within a year.\xa0Own-source revenue —\xa0revenue raised by collecting taxes and resource revenues —\xa0will also continue to be a major resource for Madawaska.All six of New Brunswick\'s\xa0Wolastoqiyik\xa0reserves keep 95 per cent of the tax collected on gas, cigarette and sales taxes at on-reserve retail operations, up to a cap of $8 million.""That shows you that we can become independent and self-governing,"" Bernard said. ""The land is important because now we can become self-sustaining.""""We don\'t need to get money from the federal government in order to exist.""Now the First Nation is actively seeking\xa0opportunities for new business ventures.\xa0In July, Madawaska announced a plan to become a licensed producer of cannabis and cannabis products.The reserve\xa0will partner with Newfoundland\xa0BeeHighVE, owned and operated by Rita Hall. Hall is expected to be among the first Indigenous women in Canada to gain status as a licensed cannabis\xa0producer.In 2019, when cannabis edibles are legalized, BeeHighVE plans to manufacture honey products infused with CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabis compound recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an active prescription drug ingredient.\xa0The company will initially operate a 20,000-square-foot growing facility\xa0in Corner Brook, N.L., and plans to create a larger plant on Madawaska.""The minute we invested in the company, [Hall] provided the authorization and permission to move forward with the application to expand the company on the reserve in New Brunswick,\' Bernard said.Madawaska, Bernard said, is in talks with the province to supply local dispensaries once the products are legal.""This is an opportunity to expand into production,"" she said, ""and a huge economic opportunity for the First Nation.""Elders like John Wallace see the transformation in the community since his younger days, when a tiny population and discrimination led to trouble finding work.""People are getting involved in decision-making,"" he said. ""People are educated.""""On this reserve, we have three lawyers. … We have engineers, construction workers, federal officers, border and immigration officers, RCMP.""""I always said this was a unique reserve in New Brunswick.""His son, Steve Wallace, agreed.The economic boom, as well as bringing jobs to the community, has brought ""more self-esteem,"" he said. ""They are looking forward to a better future.""One challenge is attracting non-Indigenous\xa0businesses to lease land on\xa0the reserve.""To open in a foreign jurisdiction was always a bit of a concern ...\xa0especially for non-native businesses who are not always well-versed in Aboriginal law.""That, too, is\xa0slowly changing since the Violette Motors Ford dealership opened in the power centre in 2016.\xa0""As soon as he did that, people realized, \'we can do it too,\' Bernard said. The Tim Hortons franchise,\xa0food court, and Quality Inn\xa0set to open in early\xa02019 are all owned by non-Indigenous people.\xa0While Edmundston and Madawaska\xa0collaborate on projects and share many services, one downside to Madawaska\'s\xa0proximity to the city is the erosion of Wolastoqiyik culture. The community holds no annual powwow, and there are no fluent speakers of Maliseet.""We\'ve lost our language, and a lot of culture comes from language,"" Bernard said. ""It\'s how you speak, and how you see things.""Our community is lacking in a lot of cultural, traditional ways of teaching and life.""In recent years, she said, there\'s been a revival, with\xa0Wolastoqiyik language courses offered in the community.\xa0The hope is to ""recapture some of our lost culture, but still live in a modern world,"" Bernard said.""We don\'t want to go back to living in longhouses or anything like that.""But we need to remember how we lived and why we got to the place we\'re at today.""Julia WrightJulia Wright is a reporter based in Saint John.

They\'re also a food source for other threatened animals, like some turtles and herons.Importing salamanders and their close relatives into the country now requires a permit, Kemp said, adding that applications will be categorized as either low or high risk, depending on a number of factors.Those include things like the species being imported, where the animal is coming from and the type of specimen — whether it\'s a live salamander or preserved.""So, for the higher-risk category of application, those ones would require a bit more information and applicants would have to be able to clearly demonstrate that the salamander specimen would not be released into Canadian ecosystems,"" Kemp said.Still, she said she doesn\'t expect there will be too many requests for exemptions, adding that during the one-year period that started in 2017, regulators likely received less than a dozen permit applications.""I think that folks are quite informed about this,"" she said.

We need our own constitution,"" MNA\xa0President Audrey Poitras said Friday.Self-government for the Alberta Métis could mean managing their own healthcare, education and child welfare systems.But self-government and harvesting rights have been prickly topics\xa0among Métis and the\xa0federal\xa0and provincial governments.At least one of those issues reached a boiling point last\xa0September when wildlife officers swooped into a cultural harvesting camp in the Métis community of Conklin and seized smoked fish. Officers alleged\xa0the fish were obtained without a licence.It caused an uproar after the community posted about the officers\' actions on social media.Alberta\'s Minister of\xa0Indigenous Relations\xa0Richard Feehan\xa0later apologized.Since the ruckus, MNA\'s legal counsel Jason Madden said the Métis Nation has been in discussions with the province about\xa0hunting and fishing concerns.And he hopes Alberta\'s provincial cabinet will approve a Métis provincial consultation and harvesting policy soon.When it comes to self-government, Madden said talks began\xa0with the federal government in January. They hope\xa0to settle on an agreement-in-principle in 2019.Already the MNA, Madden said, has achieved interim steps toward Canada recognizing Métis rights and nationhood.The federal government has agreed to a consultation policy and Parks Canada has given Métis free admission.But before an agreement-in-principle is inked, the MNA needs a constitution, Madden said.Like any sovereign government, a constitution would outline the priorities and governance structures of the Alberta Métis\xa0Nation and it would replace the organization\'s bylaws.""We\'re hoping through the work of this assembly that Métis will be developing a constitution moving towards self-government in the very near term,"" Madden said.MNA president Audrey Poitras urged the Nation\'s citizens to approve the parameters of a Métis constitution, which will be drafted after the three-day general meeting ending Sunday.Poitras and Madden both said the time is right for Alberta\'s Métis and the Crown to arrive at a self-government agreement.Recent court decisions and the political will, they said,\xa0exists to get the work done.""It is because of those court cases,"" Madden said.

""I think her doing a kind of politically charged film (Incident at Restigouche) about my reserve really kicked off my film career in my brain.""Barnaby will get to share the spotlight with his 81-year-old movie-making icon when the two screen their features at the Toronto International Film Festival.On Sept. 9, Barnaby will unveil the world premiere of his debut feature, Rhymes for Young Ghouls, which he wrote and directed. The irreverent drama is set against the backdrop of residential schools in the 1970s as it follows an aboriginal teen (Kawennahere Devery Jacobs) who exacts revenge on a sadistic Indian Agent.Meanwhile, Obomsawin\'s doc, Hi-Ho Mistahey!, will make its world premiere this Saturday with a look at the plight of the Attawapiskat First Nation in northern Ontario and the lack of funding for the education of children in First Nations communities.Between those two features and the Peter Stebbings-directed drama Empire of Dirt, which \xa0debuts at the fest on Friday, ""it turned out to be a really big year for First Nations films,"" says Canadian features programmer Agata Smoluch Del Sorbo.Barnaby predicts the trend will continue.""I think there\'s a huge fascination with film on any native reserve, because there\'s so little to do there, and nine times out of 10 what you\'re doing is kind of occupying your time going to the movies or playing video games,"" he said. ""So, I think the medium really has a presence in native reserves, particularly because there are so many films out there with native people in them.""So, I think you\'re going to start seeing a bit more native filmmakers coming out of the woodwork.""Obomsawin agrees.""I think more and more, a lot of people and a lot of young people are into this business and there\'s a lot of interest, and more and more professional people are becoming professional filmmakers,"" she said in a telephone interview. ""So, it\'s very encouraging.""Barnaby said he embarked on Rhymes for Young Ghouls because he wanted to deviate from the ""hyper-masculine"" stories he\'s tackled in the past with his three short films, which include the Genie-nominated File Under Miscellaneous.Using the ""strong, hard-headed"" women in his life as inspiration, he placed his heroine ""in a place and time where it wasn\'t very popular to be a woman or to be native.""Fifteen-year-old Aila (Jacobs) lives on the Red Crow Mi\'gMaq reservation and helps her uncle run the drug business abandoned by her father when he went to jail.Aila\'s pot dealings have made her enough money to pay corrupt Indian Agent Popper (Mark Antony Krupa) her ""truancy tax"" so she can avoid attending residential school. But her fate changes when her money is stolen and her dad (Glen Gould) gets out of jail.Barnaby, who is also an author and artist, shot the film in Montreal last fall and set the story from1969 to 1976 because ""that\'s when you start seeing the collapse of the residential school system.""The subject matter is still topical ""because families that experienced the aftermath of what happened there are still being directly affected,"" he added.Barnaby should know — his grandmother was in a residential school, as was one of his cast members.Jacobs, who\'s a\xa0Native American Mohawk, also has family members who went to residential school.The 20-year-old said when she read the script, she ""knew it was going to be something that was a game-changer that most Canadians wouldn\'t be expecting.""""I think a lot of people who go to see the film are going to be shocked by it.""But despite the shocking elements, Barnaby insisted it\'s not a political film.""I think the film is political insofar that it has natives in it, but it\'s not something I deliberately set out to do,"" he said. ""There is no pulpit-dumping, once-we-were-warriors speeches or anything like that. It\'s just a story that just so happens to have a little bit of political ideology and edge to it. But by and large, it\'s a story first, a very cinematic story, borderline exploitation film.""I think everybody\'s going to kind of get blown away by it, to be honest. I don\'t think they\'re going to realize what they\'re sitting down to see.""Perhaps one of the most surprising elements for audiences will be the humour that\'s sprinkled throughout the characters\' trying circumstances.""I think one thing that doesn\'t come across in a lot of native films is this idea that the native people as a whole have an insane sense of humour,"" said Barnaby. ""So, there are quite a lot of things in there that are inappropriately funny and shouldn\'t be laughed at, but we\'ll laugh at them because, you know, we\'re native.""""That\'s how you cope with things,"" said Jacobs. ""You laugh at inappropriate things and you just make light of it.""Obomsawin called Barnaby a ""very special"" and talented filmmaker who brings different ideas to the big screen.""He has stories sometimes that are difficult to look at, but I think it\'s very exciting to see that he\'s managed to do what he\'s done so far,"" she said.Barnaby said he hopes his film will have the same impact Obomsawin\'s doc did on him when he was young.""In that there will be some young kid out there watching TMN (The Movie Network) one day and then see my movie and say that they can do that and make a difference to some other kid 20 years from now.""I think in a really crazy way, native films are undoing a lot of the damage that the films that came before did, in giving native people an identity onscreen.""The Toronto film fest runs Sept. 5 to 15.Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

The court\xa0said it was not prepared to ""make some general statement concerning the federal government\'s fiduciary duty.""Meanwhile, the government could appeal the ruling\xa0to the Supreme Court, meaning\xa0it could be years before any benefits are seen by Métis or non-status Indians.""One of the arguments the Crown made in the case was that it\'s just going to provide a lot more litigation,"" Lovelace said.But what\xa0the ruling could\xa0mean is that Métis and non-status Indians\xa0may be entitled to the same benefits as registered status Indians. Those benefits include some\xa0tax exemptions if living on a reserve, hunting and fishing rights, health benefits and some education subsidies.""The federal government fought this ... with a vehemence because the stakes are really really high,"" said David McNab,\xa0\xa0a professor at Toronto\'s York University and Métis historian who has worked for almost 40 years on aboriginal land and treaty rights issues.""The cost\xa0—\xa0that\'s the primary motivation for the federal and provincial government. They don\'t want to be hung up with the responsibility of costs that have been built up,"" McNab said.For\xa0example, Lovelace said registered status Indians\xa0who work on reserves do not have to pay income tax on income\xa0earned on the reserve.But for\xa0non-status people who don\'t have a reserve\xa0yet live within a traditional territory,\xa0it could be argued that\xa0they will no longer have to pay income tax, he said.What could be more of a financial concern for the government are\xa0cases in which non-status Indians had\xa0paid sales tax in the\xa0past, now claim they should have been exempt\xa0 from those taxes and be\xa0reimbursed, Lovelace said.\xa0The government may also have a difficult\xa0case to make that it doesn\'t have the money to pay out all the benefits and claims.""The courts have tended to accept\xa0a little bit of that argument but they\'re also forced to recognize what\'s legal,"" Lovelace said.The ruling also\xa0means the government can no longer play the ""divide and conquer"" game between status Indians and non-status Indians and Métis, Lovelace said, adding that\xa0it could\xa0lead to a reconciliation among the groups since they are now all on equal ground.However, he did acknowledge that there could be some tension as more groups will be sharing the government pie.""There\'s always been concern that there\'s not enough money to go around, so if you add people to the pot, the meal\'s\xa0going to get thinner. I hope that\xa0can be overcome,"" Lovelace said.The decision could also prompt a spike in Métis membership applications. Randy Ranville, a genealogist with the Métis Culture and Heritage Resource Centre in Winnipeg, told The Canadian Press the centre will likely be swamped following the court decision.According to the 2006 census, nearly 400,000 Canadians self-identified as Métis, although only about half are officially recognized. Each province has a Métis organization which registers members and outlines its own requirements for status.Typically, proof lies in an official family tree, accompanied by birth certificates and other documentation with ties to the historic Métis homeland.With files from The Canadian PressAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

She says Canada won\'t recognize her right to live and work in B.C. because she was born on the American side of the Annette Island Indian Reserve.She said her visa expires July 1.""For me, what I consider home is my home community and my people\'s traditional territory, which is northern B.C.,\'\' she said. ""We\'re not immigrants to our people\'s traditional territory.\'\'Dangeli gave up a tenure-track position with the University of Alaska Southeast to teach 65 students how to speak Sm\'algyax in the community of Kitsumkalum, just outside of Terrace, because there are so few fluent speakers remaining.She says she hasn\'t said goodbye to her students yet because it\'s too difficult.""I\'ve shed a lot of tears with my elders and family but I don\'t want to do that with my students. They\'re so young and their love for the language is my inspiration and solace. I wouldn\'t have the strength to fight this battle if I didn\'t see where the hope truly lies, which is within my students,\'\' she said.After having two express entry applications for permanent residency fail, Dangeli has started a petition calling on the Canadian government to reciprocate the Jay Treaty, which was signed between the United States and Britain\xa0in 1794. The treaty allows status Indians born in Canada, who also have 50 per cent blood quantum, to live and work in the U.S.Canada does not recognize the agreement as binding because it never codified it.""The colonial border between the U.S. and Canada dissects\xa0Indigenous\xa0territories in ways that sever the lifelines between First Nation families, communities, languages and ceremonies,\'\' Dangeli\'s petition says.Dangeli says she considered applying for Indian status in Canada, but learned the two-year process hinged on the baptismal record of her great-great-great grandmother in Prince Rupert, B.C., in the 1860s.""So if she decided not to convert to Christianity I would not be considered an Indian under the Indian Act. The whole process is about one colonial institution affirming the power of another. It has nothing to do with our inherent\xa0Indigenous\xa0rights that predate colonial law,\'\' Dangeli said.The federal government has been working to resolve border issues for First Nations but has not reached a solution. In December 2016, it appointed Fred Caron to examine the issue as a special representative of the minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs.Caron met with representatives from more than 100 First Nations between January and August 2017, submitting a report to a committee of senior federal officials that is charged with developing a plan for addressing the border-crossing issues.""Among the issues highlighted in Mr. Caron\'s report, and that are being examined by the committee of senior officials, are questions relating to the important cultural and family connections between First Nations in Canada and native American communities in the United States,\'\' Crown-Indigenous\xa0Relations and Northern Affairs Canada said in a statement.Jogger who accidentally crossed U.S. border from B.C. detained for 2 weeksThe government will discuss next steps on the file with First Nations in the coming months, after the committee submits its recommendations, it said.""The government is committed to working in partnership with First Nations to address their Canada-United States border crossing concerns,\'\' the department said.Although the Jay Treaty is historic, Canadian institutions are increasingly choosing to honour it, said Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a law professor with the Peter A. Allard School of Law at the University of British Columbia and inaugural director of the school\'s Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre.She gave the example of Vancouver Island University, which offers domestic tuition for American\xa0Indigenous\xa0students who would fall under the treaty.Border issues have most commonly arisen in Eastern Canada, she said, where communities like the Akwesasne First Nation cross three borders between Ontario, Quebec and New York.Some are looking for solutions, like Mohawk leaders who called for a special identification card that would ease the border crossing, which hasn\'t been granted, she said.""Indigneous people have been coming forward and saying let\'s work this out in a practical way,\'\' she said.""It\'s a case where Canada is actually behind.\'\'Toronto lawyer Sara Mainville says border issues have been common in Eastern Canada and some First Nations leaders have taken it upon themselves to set up meetings with customs and immigration officials so their community members don\'t run into any problems, since Canada isn\'t honouring the Jay Treaty.In 2006, her own community of the Couchiching First Nation sanctioned the adoption of the husband of one of its members who was born on the American side of the Anishnaabe territory, because he needed medical care and Canada wouldn\'t recognize his rights to the territory.Mainville pointed to Canada\'s commitment to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of\xa0Indigenous\xa0Peoples as something that gives Dangeli\'s argument more weight, because it specifically says\xa0Indigenous\xa0Peoples divided by international borders have a right to maintain contact with their own members.For Dangeli\'s part, she says she hopes her situation is resolved as soon as possible, especially given the critical state of the language.""This is my heart and soul and the work is very much needed within our nation.\'\'Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

The investigation focused on the death of\xa0Neil\xa0Stonechild, a 17-year-old boy who froze to death on the outskirts of the city.\xa0Friends of Neil Stonechild mark 25 years since his deathWeighill said the Saskatoon Police Service now works\xa0extensively with local Indigenous groups, hired\xa0more Aboriginal\xa0officers, and an\xa0Indigenous woman serves as\xa0chair of the Saskatoon Board of Police Commissioners.In addition, he said, the Saskatchewan Police College now includes courses on Indigenous history, covering issues such as colonialism and residential schools.Other police services across the country are also working to improve relationships with different ethnicities and cultures, Weighill said.""There\'s absolutely no doubt in my mind that policing has really moved ahead in the last 10 to 15 years, dealing not only with Indigenous relations but with new Canadians coming to Canada,"" he said.However, Weighill says ""everybody has an unconscious bias, whether they like to believe it or not,"" and emphasizes the importance of hiring more Indigenous police officers to address that.Adams of the Thunder Bay Police Service agreed. ""If we accept the reality that bias exists at every level of society, then we must acknowledge that it will take continuing efforts to diminish its effect on the services our institutions provide.""Dealing with racial discrimination is a ""huge component"" in policing, said\xa0retired constable\xa0Grant Dokis, who was the first Indigenous officer to join the municipal police force in Sudbury, Ont., about 30 years ago.Dokis, who worked for about 15 years on the street and then another 15 as an Indigenous liaison officer, remembers facing prejudice from colleagues and members of the public, but says he dealt with it largely by educating his peers about his culture.Three decades later, Dokis says he\'s proud\xa0the Greater Sudbury Police Service employs about 25 Indigenous people and works closely with members of the community.""This just didn\'t come overnight,"" he said. ""I think early on, we had to say there was prejudice between ourselves.""One of the most significant initiatives in building trust, Dokis said, has been a ride-along program that pairs Indigenous\xa0youth with police officers.The reaction of one officer in particular sticks with him to this day.""He said, \'This is the first time in my 25-year career that I had a conversation with a young Aboriginal individual,\'""\xa0Dokis recalls.\xa0""[Officers] never had the chance to hear that young Native people had goals and aspirations and they have futures themselves.""Nicole IrelandNicole Ireland is a CBC News journalist with a special interest in health and social justice stories.

A 2015 United Nations report found that young First Nations, Métis and Inuit women were five times more likely to die under violent circumstances than their non-aboriginal counterparts.""This is a fundamental human rights issue,"" said Harvard. ""How can you look at Canada as a positive human rights defender around the world if we are violating the human rights of our people right here?""The Liberal Party, the NDP and the Green Party have pledged to call a national inquiry if elected. The Conservative Party has maintained its pre-election campaign position that an inquiry isn\'t necessary, saying there have already been many reports on the issue and that it is taking action instead, citing stronger law enforcement and family-violence prevention initiatives as examples.But in 2014, the UN\xa0special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples called on the Canadian government to ""undertake a comprehensive, nationwide inquiry ... organized in consultation with Indigenous Peoples.""""Bearing in mind the important steps already taken to inquire into the disturbing phenomenon of missing and murdered aboriginal women and girls and to develop measures to address this problem, the federal government should undertake a comprehensive, nationwide inquiry into the issue of missing and murdered aboriginal women and girls, organized in consultation with indigenous peoples.""– UN report: The Situation of Indigenous Peoples in Canada, May 2014During the election campaign, the Native Women\'s Association of Canada\xa0has spoken to young people, unions, church groups and ""anybody who would listen"" about the issue of missing and murdered aboriginal women, Harvard said, and has received ""overwhelming support"" for an inquiry.""So many people are shocked when they realize that this thing is happening right in our own backyards,"" she said. ""Once people know what\'s happening, they want to do the right thing. They\'re appalled and they want to put an end to this.""It\'s not that people are unfeeling. It\'s just that up until this point, [the issue] has been so effectively hidden, so effectively swept under the rug that the average Canadian … [is] pointed to look at oppression of women in other countries so that they\'re not looking at what\'s going on right here in Canada.""Tanya Lalonde from Buffalo Lake Métis\xa0Settlement in Alberta also believes that non-native Canadians care about missing and murdered aboriginal women, once they become aware of the issue.\xa0Now living in Montreal, the McGill University social work graduate\xa0decided to become politically active to make sure indigenous voices are heard in government and chose to work with the Liberal Party as an aboriginal advocate. \xa0This election is different than any other, Lalonde said, because the issue of missing and murdered indigenous women has actually been talked about on the campaign trail. \xa0""What\'s been really heartening for me as an indigenous young person [is] watching these issues coming to the forefront and just realizing that there are people standing with us and standing up for us,"" she said.\xa0""I think when your issues are not heard, then you feel like you don\'t matter and you feel invisible.""At Akwesasne First Nation near Cornwall, Ont., Sarah Rourke has been thinking a lot about missing and murdered indigenous women as she helps co-ordinate the visit of the travelling art exhibit Walking With Our Sisters in November. The exhibit features more than 1,700 hand-beaded tops of moccasins, representing the unfinished journeys\xa0of aboriginal women and girls who have disappeared or been murdered. \xa0Part of the preparation, Rourke said, is to ensure support is available for Akwesasne residents attending the deeply\xa0emotional event. \xa0\xa0""When I have a daughter, I am going to be worried if she leaves my home and goes to visit somewhere. It is a real reality that she may be murdered or missing,"" Rourke said. ""That\'s a fear for me, it\'s a fear for my family, it\'s a fear for community members.""Unlike Lalonde, Rourke is not involved in non-native politics. But the federal parties\' positions on an inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women\xa0and whether those positions influence Canadian voters, matter to her. \xa0""It makes a difference in my heart that they should care enough to ask where our women are,"" Rourke said. ""Anybody should be concerned. \xa0Non-native Canadians, native Canadians … politicians need to care about all Canadians.""\xa0""These [indigenous women and girls] are people,"" she added. ""Please humanize this. Please make this something that matters to you."" \xa0\xa0A formal inquiry is essential, Harvard said, because of the ""judicial power"" it holds to uncover facts through subpoenas.\xa0That legal weight, she said, ""forced"" police officers to reveal information that would otherwise have been considered confidential in the 2012 British Columbia inquiry into women murdered by serial killer Robert Pickton.\xa0That inquiry found that investigators had failed the victims, who were disproportionately aboriginal. \xa0\xa0A national inquiry is also necessary, Harvard said, to educate Canadians about the scope of the problem.""You need the inquiry to really expose the truth, and that\'s how we\'re going to have long-term effective change,"" she said.But immediate steps are also needed,\xa0Harvard said,\xa0to prevent more women and girls from being killed or disappearing. She called the Conservative Party\'s argument that it is taking action instead of holding an inquiry a ""false paradox.""""When you go in to see a doctor, never would you be positioned to have the doctor say, \'Well you can have a diagnostic test or you can have treatment but you can\'t have both,\'"" Harvard said. ""It can\'t be an either-or and it needs to go together so that whatever outcome we have, whatever national action plan, is well-informed and effective and addressing the real causes.""Harvard said she hopes Canadians will talk to their political candidates about\xa0missing and murdered aboriginal women.\xa0\xa0\xa0""It\'s really important to make this a mainstream issue,"" she said. ""This is not a feminist issue, this is not even an aboriginal issue.

He\'s logged thousands of hours developing it, and says he\'s working to turn it into an Indigenous-led non-for-profit organization and educational tool.\xa0""The site wasn\'t built so Indigenous people know their territories better — they know them plenty well,"" said Temprano, who described himself as a settler in Canada.\xa0\xa0""A lot of settlers are not really aware of the situation with the land, and a lot of people are vaguely interested in it, but there aren\'t many resources to explore it. I\'m really happy to see that it\'s becoming useful to Indigenous Peoples themselves.""The site, which Temprano set up in 2015, allows users to browse a global map or search by a zip or postal code\xa0and see colourful representations of the\xa0First Nations, Inuit or Métis territories any given location is within.\xa0""It\'s not like you\'re going to look at a place and see just one nation,"" said Temprano.\xa0""They overlap. [The map] is busy, and it helps give you a sense of the complexity and diversity of the land\'s history.""\xa0The site also includes a teacher\'s guide, a blog that chronicles its development, and information about contributors and sources.Land acknowledgements are becoming more commonplace at events where officials address the public. The federal government currently does not have any significant resources outlining ancestral Indigenous territories. A spokesperson for Indigenous and Northern Affairs\xa0said requests to Indigenous communities about territory acknowledgements is done on a case-by-case basis.\xa0Temprano said the idea came from his own interest in understanding Canada\'s history and the delicate theories behind land ownership. He said knowing his place in the matter has been important to him throughout the site\'s development.\xa0""[The site] can be a little threatening to settler identity at times, because it has to do with who owns the land, and the history of colonialism,"" he said.\xa0""I made it as an attempt to just plant a few seeds in different people\'s minds. The idea would be to lead people gently into having historical consciousness. Maybe that can lead to awareness in other parts of their lives.""\xa0Temprano said he takes his research seriously. If he\'s not able to find information about the territories from the nations themselves, he tries to find as many sources as possible to confirm the general outline of a given territory.\xa0Historical maps will provide some general outlines, but he looks for studies related to reserve lands, too, usually as part of a government\'s desire to access the land, Temprano said.\xa0He also receives a lot of contributions from community members, educators and geographers. He said in one case, someone just sent him 20 years worth of research and said ""here you go — use it.""\xa0""I have to be very careful. I\'d never want the site to cause harm to a nation\'s identity,"" said Temprano.\xa0\xa0The site is funded and operated by Temprano himself, he said, though he\'s\xa0recently acquired some help to handle social media outreach.\xa0There are no ads, and no revenue being generated from the site, which he said is important for the public to understand.\xa0It may serve as an example of what Temprano can accomplish as a web developer, indirectly offering him opportunities for more work, but for now, it\'s just a passion project, he said.\xa0""It\'s basically just me,"" said Temprano. ""But I\'m working on that.""\xa0He\'s in the early stages of turning the project into an Indigenous-led non-profit operation. More and more, he\'s seen the site being used by Indigenous users, sharing it with their networks because their territories aren\'t seen on many contemporary maps. He said putting the resource in the hands of those whom it stands to represent is crucial.""There are a lot of complex questions that come with the site growing. You start touching on questions of indigeneity — who counts as Indigenous, who should be included on the map, who shouldn\'t be,"" said Temprano.\xa0""I\'m doing it because it could positively impact people\'s lives. I\'m not necessarily saying we need to act this way about land, or this person owns it. That\'s complicated. It\'s not my place to comment on that. The most important thing to me is when I hear people talk about taking it home and sharing it with their parents, their grandparents.

These units have a\xa0proud military history, having fought not only in the Second World War but the Korean war, and participated\xa0in NATO and UN peacekeeping missions.But in 2004, the Patricias, the remaining unit at Kapyong,\xa0relocated\xa0to\xa0CFB\xa0Shilo, about two hours west.\xa0The Department of National Defence declared Kapyong\xa0Barracks\xa0surplus and initially planned to sell it.The 64-hectare parcel of land was estimated to be worth up to $100 million in\xa02015. But\xa0it got tied up in\xa0treaty land entitlement claims and court challenges.\xa0Two months ago, Ottawa signed an\xa0agreement in principle\xa0with seven Treaty One First Nations that would turn it into an ""urban reserve"" — land the federal government has designated as a First Nations reserve within a city or town.""It\'s going to probably be a billion-dollar development over time,"" says\xa0Long Plain Chief Dennis\xa0Meeches, who belongs to one of the First Nations developing the land. ""And we want to do it right the first time.""Sandwiched between two affluent residential neighborhoods, the Kapyong\xa0Barracks are a long-time fixture in the city\'s\xa0landscape.Maj.\xa0Dez\xa0Desjardins, who is\xa0responsible for the Armed Forces\' property operations in Manitoba, said the military is not allowing access to the buildings. But during a recent tour of the complex, he confirmed their state of disrepair,\xa0despite annual costs of\xa0about $1.5 million for security, taxes and upkeep.Walking down cracked and pitted paths, Desjardins\xa0pointed out holes in the roofs of several buildings.\xa0After 14 years of not being used, he\xa0says none of the buildings are salvageable.""We have standing water. Portions of the buildings have collapsed,"" he says. ""And we\'ve also had some animals living in a couple of the buildings.""In 2015, then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper said he wouldn\'t appeal a decision by the Federal Court of Appeal, which upheld an earlier ruling that said Ottawa had failed to consult four First Nations about the future development of the site.The agreement struck earlier this year gives a group of seven Treaty One First Nations the opportunity to develop the land as an urban reserve,\xa0providing\xa0Indigenous\xa0businesses the same tax exemptions they get on traditional reserves. There are approximately 120 urban reserves across Canada.He says the site of the current barracks\xa0will be a place for Indigenous government offices, retail, arts and culture spaces, hotels and condos,\xa0though he cautions that it\'s\xa0too early to show any of the plans that have been drawn up.""Because of its location, it is a high-traffic area. And we are looking at strengthening the Indigenous economy through urban reserves,"" he says.There still are some challenges to work through.\xa0Part of the deal hinges on the City of Winnipeg getting access to some of the land\xa0so it can widen the main thoroughfare running beside it.The group of chiefs ""don\'t want to sell us the land, and we can\'t expropriate the land from them, because it\'s under the federal [government],"" says John\xa0Orlikow, the area\'s councillor and chair of the city\'s planning, property and development committee.""They would like us to lease the land for 99 years. We\'re not that keen on it, as a city. If we\'re going to build a road on it, we\'d rather have it under the city.""Orlikow knows some local residents aren\'t happy with the idea of an urban reserve there\xa0— for example, some have expressed\xa0concern\xa0that a casino may be built on the site. However, Orlikow acknowledges citizens\xa0will be consulted during the development process.""[Residents] don\'t know what\'s going to happen there, so they\'re curious,"" says Orlikow. ""I\'m personally quite excited about it. I\xa0think it will be a good infill,"" he says.But the finished product is still years away.\xa0For now, the land is occupied by wildlife and demolition crews.Karen PaulsNational ReporterKaren Pauls is an award-winning journalist who has been a national news reporter in Manitoba since 2004.

He was lying on the chesterfield in the living room of their Yarmouth, N.S., home, his body ravaged by tuberculosis.""He had consumption and he knew he only had a few months to live,"" recalls Mary Lou Parker. ""He told me we had Indian blood in us, which made us Metis.""The 12-year-old felt proud of her Indigenous roots. But she was warned never to reveal her ""half-breed"" heritage, as it was then called, for fear of being shunned.So she kept it secret until years later, in a quest to explore her identity and gain recognition, she formed the Eastern Woodland Metis Nation Nova Scotia, using a term — Metis — usually associated with Western Canada.Parker has since discovered there are many more people like her in Eastern Canada.Her group — one of many eastern Metis groups to emerge in recent years — has grown exponentially, and now has 30,000 members.But the sudden proliferation of self-reported Metis in Eastern Canada has emerged as a profoundly divisive debate.Census data show the number of people who call themselves Metis soared nearly 150 per cent in Quebec and 125 per cent in Nova Scotia from 2006 to 2016, according to Statistics Canada. Dozens of new Metis organizations cropped up over the same period.Many use identity cards that look much like Indian Status cards. Others have tried to claim Indigenous rights through the courts, fuelling a perception that the Indigenous\xa0newcomers are so-called rights grabbers.""It\'s one thing to say \'I\'m First Nation, this is part of my culture and I want to learn more about it,""\' says Cheryl Maloney, a Mi\'kmaw activist and Cape Breton University political science professor.""But that\'s not what they\'re saying. They\'re trying to be viewed as Metis under the Constitution, and to have rights and benefits.""Many critics reject outright that there is a distinct Metis identity in the Maritimes and Quebec.People of mixed blood in the region either integrated into Indigenous communities or assimilated with European newcomers, unlike the distinct Metis People of Louis Riel in Western Canada.""When you\'re looking at the Maritimes and Quebec, the children of intermarriage were accepted by either party, in our case the Mi\'kmaq or the Acadian,"" Mi\'kmaw elder and historian Daniel Paul says.""There was no such thing as a Metis community here in this region.""For those who consider themselves eastern Metis, the rejection of their identity is exclusionary and mean-spirited — a continuation of their oppressed status and the maltreatment mixed-raced people have faced for generations.They argue that a distinct mixed-heritage people existed in the region with a shared history and culture, not simply Indigenous ancestry. But these interracial people were compelled to identify as white for fear of discrimination.""We were forced to assimilate with white people, our identities stolen,"" says Parker, the grand chief of the Eastern Woodland Metis. ""Now we\'re reclaiming our native heritage.""The 82-year-old says she\'s not looking for benefits — just recognition and inclusion.""We\'re not begging for money ... we\'re not after government hand outs,"" she says. ""We know who we are, we just want the recognition.""For the Mi\'kmaq people who have made significant sacrifices fighting for treaty rights, though, it\'s troubling. They say Indigenous Peoples suffered enormously from efforts to assimilate them. This includes the Residential School system — what one federal bureaucrat called the ""final solution to the Indian Problem.""""We\'ve gone through hell and back over the last many years with government and settlers,"" says Allison Bernard, fisheries co-ordinator with the Mi\'kmaq Rights Initiative from Eskasoni First Nation in Cape Breton.Skepticism of self-reported Metis in the region is understandable given the experience of Indigenous people here, he says, pointing out that he was forced to defend his right to hunt in court after shooting a moose.""Throughout history we resisted colonization and spoke out about the horrors against Indigenous Peoples,"" says Jarvis Googoo, a non-practising lawyer in Halifax and a Mi\'kmaw from We\'koqma\'q First Nation.""Where were these Metis people all this time?""Yet hiding Indigenous heritage was a matter of survival, says Karole Dumont, chief of the Council of the First Metis People of Canada.""If you could pass off as white you did,"" she says. ""Being Indian or Metis was dirty and it was taboo.""Metis families ""hid in plain sight,"" Dumont says, and while they didn\'t ""advertise"" their Indigenous roots, they continued living as Metis in secret.""Our grandparents and great-grandparents did whatever they had to do to ensure that none of their kids ended up in residential schools.""The debate over the eastern Metis movement was thrust into the spotlight earlier this year when the East Coast Music Association pulled a Nova Scotia nominee from consideration for an Indigenous artist award.At issue was the heritage of Cape Breton guitarist Maxim Cormier, who identifies as Acadian and Metis. His name was withdrawn from the Indigenous artist of the year category after questions surfaced about his background.Dumont says revoking the nomination was ""reckless and unfair.""""The Metis people are the only people who have to lay out their pedigree and prove their identity in Canada.""But Googoo says jobs, education and awards programs geared towards Indigenous Peoples are an important piece of reconciliation. He says having newly identified Metis flood those programs is a step backwards.""It\'s worsening the problem because these organizations think they\'re doing their part for reconciliation.""The nomination controversy is a microcosm of the maelstrom of debate surrounding the Eastern Metis.American anthropologist Circe Sturm uses the term ""race shifting"" to describe white Americans identifying as Cherokee to ""reclaim or create something they feel they have lost"" or ""opt out of mainstream white society.""Darryl Leroux, associate professor at Saint Mary\'s University in Halifax, draws parallels between the new Cherokee communities in the U.S. and Metis groups in Eastern Canada.He questions whether having ""an ancestor from the 1600s makes one Indigenous today,"" especially when there are no cultural or historical attachments to the Indigenous ancestry.Leroux points out that his own genealogy includes Mohawk and Algonquin ancestors, but that doesn\'t make him Indigenous, he says. Yet some of his relatives are claiming to be Metis — creating a rift in his family.""Often there\'s only one person in a family claiming Metis identity,"" he says. ""Even their kin are not on board with what they\'re doing.""In a journal article he co-wrote with Alberta academic Adam Gaudry, ""White Settler Revision and Making Metis Everywhere,"" Leroux identifies a ""tactical use of long-ago racial mixing to re-imagine a \'Metis\' identity.""Leroux notes the spikes in self-identified Metis populations followed court decisions recognizing treaty rights.While fewer than a thousand Nova Scotians identified as Metis in the 1996 census, that number more than tripled to 3,135 after the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed Mi\'kmaq treaty rights in the 1999 Marshall decision, according to Statistics Canada.The population swelled again after the 2003 Powley decision, when the Supreme Court affirmed Metis have an Aboriginal right to hunt for food.By the 2006 census, self-identified Metis in Nova Scotia had once again more than doubled, reaching 23,315 by 2016. The increase mirrors a similar trend in New Brunswick and Quebec.""It cannot be a coincidence that it shifts following court decisions,"" says Leroux, who cites evidence that some of the people now identifying as Metis were initially opposed to Indigenous treaty rights and even had ties to white supremacist groups.Jean Teillet, lead counsel in the landmark Powley case, is the great-grandniece of Louis Riel and one of the country\'s top Metis and First Nations rights lawyers.Her argument — which the highest court in the land ultimately adopted — was that a rights-bearing Metis community must prove more than a genealogical connection to an Indigenous ancestor. The Metis Nation out west, for example, has an origin story, a name, kinship ties, language, traditions, symbols, territory and culture such as music, dance and food.""This is not just about individuals who have what I call an ever-so-great Indian grandmama,"" she says. ""This is a historical people that came into being before Canada asserted itself on their territory.""Teillet says the Metis claims of Eastern Canada appear to hinge on one key marker of membership — a genealogical connection — without any other evidence.""Sometimes these people in Eastern Canada rest their entire claim on a 400-year-old connection to one First Nations woman,"" she says. ""There is nothing more there.""Around 20 court cases have been launched by self-reported Metis in the region claiming Aboriginal rights. Each of them has failed, Teillet says.In one decision, a judge said it would be ""easier to nail Jell-O to the wall"" than find evidence to support the claim, she says.""I think they\'re concocting a story out of thin air.""But some researchers studying the phenomenon argue that there is empirical and archival evidence that supports the existence of eastern Metis.Daphne Williamson, an aboriginal lawyer who works with the Nova Scotia Wampanoag community and Acadian Metis groups in the province, says the community didn\'t disappear — it was disrupted and dispersed during the Acadian Expulsion.Still, she argues that their identity, language, culture and sense of community persist to the present day.Sebastien Malette, assistant professor at Carleton University, says genealogical data shows southwest Nova Scotia had three communities: First Nations people, ""pure blood"" Acadian settlers, and the ""sang-meles,"" or mixed blood.""The so-called pure Acadians of white descent didn\'t want to marry the Acadians with Indian blood,"" so a Metis people distinctive from the Acadian and the Mi\'kmaq formed, Malette says.""There can be an invisible community due to stigma,"" he says. ""They have a long history of being stigmatized due to their heritage and being told they don\'t exist.""Malette admits some eastern Metis may be motivated by hunting and fishing treaty rights. But he said the constitution of certain Metis groups have the stated objective of not interfering with Mi\'kmaq rights.""I certainly can\'t vouch for everyone,"" he says. ""But there are many Metis who feel aligned with their Mi\'kmaq roots and feel a friendship and a closeness to the First Nations and just want their identity recognized.""Some of the Metis groups, though, have issued membership cards that look like Indian Status cards and are using them to receive benefits.It\'s a problem Metis activists acknowledge.

It also includes modern teachings about present-day Indigenous movements such as Idle No More.Indigenous Canada can be taken at a student\'s own pace or with a cohort of others who will learn together. Gareau said the response to the course has been overwhelmingly positive.""What\'s really great about this course is that it touches Indigenous people as much as it does non-Indigenous people,"" he said.Two months ago, Shirley Jubinville didn\'t know she was a Sixties Scoop survivor. She was taken from her family when she was young and adopted into a white family.The Sixties Scoop refers to an estimated 20,000 Indigenous children across Canada who were taken from their families by child welfare officials from the 1960s through to the 1980s and placed with non-Indigenous families. Many experienced\xa0loss of culture, language and identity, and even physical and sexual abuse.Jubinville was fortunate — she said her adoptive parents were loving and treated her as part of the family. In fact, she felt so much a part of the family that she dealt for most of her life with an identity crisis.""I lived all my life thinking I was basically a white person because I was raised in a white family,"" she told CBC\'s Radio Active.

""We\xa0have a solid court decision to start the onslaught of litigation.""Madden said the decision will allow the Métis to move forward with negotiations to determine what remedy may be required for past discrimination\xa0–— when Métis were not considered as equals with status Indians and Inuit.""What\xa0we are hoping is\xa0… based upon negotiations that they will find a place for the Métis in how [the] Indian Affairs [department] currently operates,"" he said.\xa0""The Métis have some wind in their sails.""The president of the Manitoba Métis Federation said they are taking Tuesday\'s ruling cautiously, and wanting to make it clear that the Métis identity will not be lost.""We have to be very cautious about the decision because being classified or bundled together as just Indians, or the title Indians, you know categorized as one group … we are our own nation,"" said David Chartrand, who is also\xa0vice-president of the Métis National Council of Canada.The decision is widely expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court, and the federal government\'s reaction on Thursday suggested it was contemplating taking another go at it.""We are reviewing the court\'s decision to determine the next steps,"" said Jan O\'Driscoll, spokesman for Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Duncan.""Our government continues to work in partnership with all aboriginals across Canada to address shared priorities such as education, economic development and jobs.""He noted that the Federal Court said its decision is not about ""the interpretation or application of particular rights either under the Constitution or under specific agreements, nor is it about aboriginal rights.""Conservative Senator Patrick Brazeau, who\xa0is former national chief of the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples,\xa0told host Evan Solomon on CBC\'s\xa0Power & Politics that\xa0the court\'s decision and the\xa0Idle No More protest movement are part of a national discussion he sees as an opportunity.""Whether it\'s appealed or not, it will be a negotiations process between non-status organizations and Métis organizations with the federal government,"" he said.\xa0Again, it\'s all part of an ongoing dialogue that\'s taking place.""The court did not get specific about what the federal government should actually do now that Métis and non-status Indians fall into the broader category of ""Indians.""""The court is not prepared to make some general statement concerning fiduciary duty,"" Phelan\'s ruling states.""Given the declaration of right in respect of section 91(24), one would expect that the federal government would act in accordance with whatever duty arises in respect of any specific matter touching on the nonclarified fiduciary relationship.""Phelan plowed through constitutional and aboriginal history going back to before Confederation to come to the conclusion that Métis and non-status Indians should actually be considered Indians under modern law.The case for Canada\'s 400,000 non-status Indians was more clear-cut than the case for the 200,000 Métis, but on balance, historical evidence weighs in favour of the Métis too, he wrote.With files from CBC NewsTo encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada\'s online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

That means that throughout history, 99 per cent of films about Indigenous people have not been made by us. We deserve that opportunity as much as anyone does.Duncan McCue: Then, what are the barriers facing Indigenous filmmakers?Lisa: Filmmaking is expensive, versus writing a book or painting a picture.Whenever you have a high barrier to entry\xa0—\xa0meaning you need a lot of money to make this product —\xa0you get institutional ceilings where people who have not been in the mainstream have not had the access to power, not had access to funding, not had all the personal connections through the way that they grew up.People on the outside of that over-culture are reaching these ceilings.Alethea: I\'ve been doing this 15 years, and I don\'t know how many times I\'ve been told, \'Oh, we\'re already doing an Indigenous story this year.\'So, that\'s a barrier. The fact that we\'re just a spice sprinkled throughout. We can\'t be more.Jesse: Even when CBC introduced their latest schedule of shows, there are more shows about Indigenous people made by non-Indigenous people than there are shows made by Indigenous people.That is an ongoing issue that we\xa0need to overcome if we ever expect to get Indigenous stories any space on screens.Duncan McCue: How might the narrative change as we see more and more Indigenous filmmakers?Lisa: When I look at non-Indigenous-made films about Indigenous people, I see so much missing. You know, they might be well intentioned, trying to do the right thing, aiming towards reconciliation, but ... we do not see our cultures on the screen.So, I think the opportunity there is to have better stories, more complex representations of our culture, more complex representations of the journey that we\'re on as a Canada moving towards a reconciled future.Duncan McCue: Take a film like Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner. What kind of impact did that have for the Inuit narrative?Alethea: It\'s huge. When I was researching traditional tattoos at the time, so many —\xa0even Inuk —\xa0had no idea that they existed.Then Atanarjuat came out and suddenly everyone knew what Inuit tattoos looked like.That was a really powerful experience for me, as an Inuk, when it comes to Inuit identity, but also as a filmmaker. Atanarjuat is one of the most popular Canadian films of all time. It\'s just not an argument that these films won\'t be successful anymore.Duncan McCue: It seems that Indigenous films don\'t only have to entertain people. They also have to be political. They have to educate Canadians. Will we get to a time where an Indigenous filmmaker can just do a rom-com?Jesse: Yes. But ultimately, for me, this is about us being human. There are real pressing issues in our communities that require that Canada sees us as human if they\'re ever going to be addressed. Art is one pathway to create those human connections.So, to me, this isn\'t just about these incredibly talented artists and telling our stories on screens. It\'s [what] the connections that get those stories on screens and into Canadian homes will mean for real life issues —\xa0life and death issues —\xa0our communities are facing right now.Maybe that can contribute to solving those long-term — and finding a new Canada that tells different stories about itself and the people that live here — and move forward in a more human way.WATCH: Duncan McCue\'s panel discussion about Indigenous film from The NationalDuncan McCueCBC host and reporterDuncan McCue is host of CBC Radio One\'s Cross Country Checkup and a correspondent for CBC\'s The National.

This is their politics.\xa0It is a completely separate system from electing city councillors, MLAs and MPs, but often substitutes and sucks up scant energy which can be applied to understanding and participating in mainstream politics.Many indigenous people refuse to vote in their own elections because they are a creature of the government, not their own traditions.\xa0First Nations people often do not want to be counted in a ballot box or on a census form because the provincial government uses that data to collect per capita grants on their behalf from the federal government.And voting is not the only method of political expression. The most well-known methods indigenous people have used to participate in the political process with varying degrees of success have been demonstrations and protests like road and railway blockades.Idle No More was most effective protesting\xa0legislation in omnibus bills by holding mildly disruptive round dances and distributing literature which reasonably explained their causePerhaps the aboriginal electoral process leading to local chiefs, territorial and provincial grand chiefs and a national chief is good enough.\xa0First Nations could just rely on the leaders they elect through their own political process to lobby and get the federal government to live up to the Treaties.Some indigenous leaders say we need a new and different electoral system,\xa0perhaps something like they have in New Zealand where a certain number of seats are set aside for the indigenous Maori people.In the end, it seems to come full circle, and First Nations people need to recognize how important it is to vote in a federal election, just like 61 per cent (on average) of the rest of the population does. \xa0That could be boosted by some important, high profile issue that brings out the native vote, like free trade or the GST or conscription has done for the general population in the past.As they say, ""It doesn\'t matter how you vote, just be sure to vote.""In the meantime, indigenous Liberal candidate for Winnipeg Centre, Robert-Falcon Ouelette, has come up with a way of looking at it all that seems to combine the best of both worlds.""This election is my Idle No More,""\xa0Ouelette says.\xa0Even if voting is much more complicated for indigenous voters, you cannot win if you do not play.There is nothing to win when First Nations remain nations within\xa0but not represented within.Don Marks is a Winnipeg writer and the editor of Grassroots NewsTo encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada\'s online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

The audit says there is not enough funding to pay for maintenance and upkeep.""As quickly as new units come on stream, they require aggressive maintenance because of the overcrowding and heavy ""wear and tear"" they take,"" says the February 2011 report posted on the Aboriginal Affairs website this month.""There is not yet sufficient capacity within First Nations communities to do the maintenance, and limited personal funds with which to pay for someone else to do the work.""A spokeswoman for Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Duncan says the government is well aware of the problems, and is putting substantial resources towards resolving them.""We recognize more needs to be done and we will continue to work with First Nations, as we have for the last five years, to address this important issue,"" spokeswoman Michelle Yao said in an email.There are serious health and safety consequences for communities when housing is allowed to crumble, the report warns.Overcrowding is still a major problem, although not as bad as in the past, the report adds. The proportion of houses considered overcrowded has dropped by a third over 13 years, but it is still six times higher than for non-aboriginal Canadians.The federal government regularly spends about $272 million a year on on-reserve housing, and also allotted an additional $192 million over five years in the 2005 budget.The audit did not examine the most recent bout of spending through the federal government\'s stimulus plan, which put substantial money into construction of social housing and infrastructure.Rather, the review focused on implementation of the First Nations housing policy that was first introduced in 1996 and persists to this day.The policy included ministerial loan guarantees that natives could access in order to buy their own on-reserve homes. People living on reserves can own the building, but not the land underneath it, since it is owned collectively by the First Nation.But the audit said that while the loans have supported the purchase of 26,000 homes over 13 years, and the default rate is low, the program is rife with contingent liability problems.The review also underlined jurisdictional challenges.Governments and First Nations decided long ago that they should share responsibility for building and maintaining on-reserve housing. But no one is exactly sure what this ""shared responsibility"" means, the audit points out.""Until that understanding is negotiated, (Aboriginal Affairs) and First Nations are left trying to achieve the objectives of the housing policy through murky waters.""The report urges Ottawa to clarify its policies and objectives, devise better ways to train local community leaders to keep watch over housing quality and quantity, and to make sure that new housing at least meets building code requirements.The audit also says Ottawa needs to figure out a cost-effective way to deal with the growing demand for housing.The government\'s response to the audit indicates that it agrees with the recommendations and has plans underway for improvements.First Nations housing problems are so intertwined with pervasive poverty on reserves that they need to be looked at together, says John Beaucage, chairman of the First Nations Market Housing Fund.He believes the housing problem could at least be alleviated by shifting some of the focus to affordable housing geared towards people with some income, instead of solely looking at social housing geared to people with no market income.In many places, he says people of modest means wind up living in homes meant for the poorest of the poor, partly because that\'s all there is available, and partly because they\'re considered better tenants since they can afford the upkeep.The federal stimulus plan, he added, was helpful for many reserves because it paid for water and sewage systems that can be used as the backbone for building multiple housing units.Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

Canada decision of the Supreme Court of Canada,"" the Department of Indigenous and Northern Affairs (INAC) said in a news release.MMF president David Chartrand said it was historic and would create ""the frame of the house.""""It\'s a very, very important document, a very important time in history and something that we waited 146 years\xa0— 32 years in the courtroom\xa0— for,"" he said.In 2013, the Supreme Court found the federal government failed to follow through on a promise it made to the Métis people more than 145 years ago.The Manitoba Act of 1870 promised to set aside 5,565 square kilometres of land for 7,000 children of the Red River Métis. That land includes what is now the city of Winnipeg.The land deal was made in order to settle the Red River resistance, which was fought by Métis struggling to hold onto their land amid growing white settlements. Part of the Act was to make sure that Métis communities had an advantage in the newly formed province, but it took 15 years for the land to be distributed through a random lottery, destroying the dream of a Métis homeland.A legal challenge by the MMF sought recognition for the treatment of its people after the 1870 government land deal. The case went to the Supreme Court, which declared that ""the federal Crown failed to implement the land grant provision set out in s.31 of the Manitoba Act, 1870, in accordance with the honour of the Crown.""The decision did not order any remedies, but steps have been made, INAC said. In 2015, the government appointed a ministerial special representative on Métis engagement to ""explore ways to advance dialogue on reconciliation.""INAC said Friday\'s agreement ""sets the stage for time-limited exploratory talks to see if the parties can find the common ground to move into formal negotiations,""\xa0but details of a timeline were not provided by the government or the MMF.INAC said the goal is to develop a framework over the coming months.Chartrand said he expects the framework to be together by the fall. It will need\xa0to be ratified by the prime minister before the parties can negotiate a settlement, which could be a monetary payment for a trust or possibly lands.""It\'s going to change the very lives\xa0of our nation forever, from now on, once this thing comes into its full settlement,"" Chartrand said.Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

The First Nations Education Act is the centrepiece of Prime Minister Stephen Harper\'s aboriginal affairs agenda.A recent C.D. Howe Institute report determined that almost half of aboriginal students nationwide fail to get to Grade 12. The study found Manitoba had the worst record of six provinces with substantial aboriginal populations, with 63 per cent of natives failing to graduate high school.""First Nation youth represent the fastest growing segment of the population in Canada yet they have one of the lowest graduation rates,"" Valcourt added in his statement.""Our government has listened to the calls from First Nation leadership, educators, technicians and youth who are unhappy with the current \'non-system\' that has been failing First Nation students for years. This draft legislative proposal is a significant step forward.""The government\'s 32-page draft bill, arriving as major unrest and discontent continues to simmer among First Nations communities, calls for an outside inspector to review school standards and performance every year on native reserves, and to make suggestions for improvement when necessary.If the inspector finds that ""major and persistent problems"" aren\'t being dealt with by First Nations, Ottawa can then appoint a temporary official to manage schools, particularly if there are ""major risks to students\' safety and outcomes.""Leading up to the unveiling of the legislation, aboriginal leaders cautioned the government against exerting too much control over First Nations.Tyrone McNeil, president of the Vancouver-based First Nations Education Steering Committee, said a federal cash infusion for First Nations schools is the most critical issue at hand, and accused the government of treating funding ""only as an after-thought"" in its draft legislation.""It\'s really upsetting and disconcerting ... the funding is missing, and adequately investing in First Nations education is in the interest of all Canadians,"" he said Tuesday night.""The really hurtful piece of this is that the federal government is going to be more demanding, yet we\'ll be funded less and expected to do more, and then be held accountable for that. And there\'s very little accountability to parents and communities; all the accountability goes back to the minister. It\'s ludicrous.""Other aboriginal groups and education advocates have warned that the Harper government risks repeating the paternalistic mistakes of the past in its proposals. The Conservatives, meantime, say the legislation is ultimately aimed at giving First Nations control over their own education.Carolyn Bennett, the Liberals\' aboriginal affairs critic, urged the government to rethink its strategy.""The Conservatives should push pause on this flawed, top-down strategy, sit down with First Nations communities and build a workable, fully funded plan that respects, supports and empowers First Nations to control their own education systems,"" she said in a statement.The Harper government released a so-called blueprint document this summer that promised to give First Nations authority over and accountability for their education programs.But since then, several groups have urged Ottawa to abandon the blueprint, saying it doesn\'t meet standards set out by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.The UN, meantime, announced earlier this month that it\'s launching a probe into Canada\'s human rights record with its aboriginal people.The government is calling for feedback on its draft legislation before introducing it in the House of Commons.Under the legislation, aboriginal councils remain responsible for schools on their reserves with the option to contract out work to provincial school boards or private educators if they\'d prefer.The bill also allows native councils to form First Nations education authorities that could control all the aboriginal schools in various regions of the country. Those authorities could hire teachers and principals, manage budgets and develop curricula that meets provincial standards while focusing on aboriginal culture and language.To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada\'s online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

['2014-04-12T19:45:27.350Z'],['Shacks and slop pails: infrastructure crisis on native reserves'],['Kazi Stastna'],['https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/shacks-and-slop-pails-infrastructure-crisis-on-native-reserves-1.1004957'],"['aQuebec may have its\xa0crumbling overpasses\xa0and Ontario its aging power plants, but there is no doubt that\xa0many of Canada\'s most glaring infrastructure problems are on aboriginal reserves.From roads to water to housing, First Nations\' infrastructure troubles run the gamut.In Wasagamack First Nation, a remote northern Manitoba community, the majority of residents have no indoor plumbing and rely on outhouses, slop pails and frequent trips to\xa0a communal water station. The same is true across the border in\xa0Pikangikum, an Ojibwa community in\xa0northwestern\xa0Ontario where 70 per cent of the population is under 25 and which has had an alarming number of suicides among youth.The CBC News series\xa0The Big Fix\xa0examines Canada\'s crumbling infrastructure and what\'s needed to repair it. Stories\xa0that look at\xa0infrastructure challenges facing First Nations include:Housing: Nearly half of the houses on Canadian reserves require major repairs, and\xa0overcrowding rates are six times greater on reserve than off.\xa0Read the articleWater: Bringing water and sewer systems on reserves\xa0up to standard and maintaining them that way for the next 10 years would cost about $10 billion.\xa0Read the articlePikangikum:\xa0Watch\xa0Coleen Rajotte\'s report\xa0on\xa0the\xa0troubled Ojibwa community\xa0and visit the\xa08th Fire Facebook site\xa0to get a preview of 8th Fire, an upcoming\xa0CBC-Radio-Canada documentary series on aboriginal peoples in Canada.Three northern Ontario reserves off of James Bay declared a state of emergency in late September because of a housing shortage.One of them, Attawapiskat, about 500 kilometres north of Timmins, Ont.,\xa0has resorted to housing people in uninsulated sheds, wood-frame tents heated by wood stoves and donated construction trailers, where some families have been living for two years already.""Even\xa0newborn babies are residing in these sheds, and there\'s no water hookup and no hydro hookup,"" Attawapiskat Chief Theresa Spence said.Of the roughly 500,000 people who live on\xa0Canada\'s 3,117 reserves,\xa0thousands are still without indoor plumbing\xa0and a quarter rely on water systems that pose potential risks to health, safety and the environment. More than 120 native communities were under a drinking water advisory\xa0as of Oct. 31.Housing on reserves is generally substandard, dilapidated and overcrowded.Portables, not buildings, are the norm for schoolchildren in many First Nations communities.Remote reserves depend on ice roads and have only a two- to three-month window to bring in building supplies for the year.The infrastructure problems, which bring with them a\xa0host of physical and social ills, have persisted for many years, and even the government officials responsible for Canada\'s 631 First Nations admit there has been little to no improvement in recent decades.""The gap between First Nations and\xa0…Canadians has, seemingly, over the last few generations just grown so deep,"" said\xa0Assembly of First Nations\xa0National Chief Shawn Atleo in an interview with CBCNews.ca. ""A lot of it has to do with maybe even\xa0\'out of sight, out of mind\'\xa0—\xa0not knowing what\'s happening in places like northern Saskatchewan or northern Manitoba.""The images of communities\xa0where there\'s slop pails, no running water, no reliable power\xa0… it\'s just not a story that is well understood. Nor [are] perhaps the underlying reasons, particularly, the policy reasons\xa0— the fact that we\'ve all inherited an Indian Act that\'s 125 years old now that isn\'t serving anybody.""Since 2006, the federal government has spent about $1.4 billion on native housing and, by 2013, will have spent $2.5 billion on water and sewage systems. Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC), the federal department responsible for First Nations, said it is committed to improving the quality of life and provision of safe drinking water on reserves, but federal spending has not kept up with need.The\xa0AFN estimates\xa0that capital expenditures on reserves are underfunded by $169 to $189 million annually and operations and maintenance expenditures by $11 million. It says 40 new schools, at a cost of $12.5 million each, and 85,000 housing units would have to be built just\xa0to\xa0meet current needs.[IMAGEGALLERY galleryid=1541 size=small]The kind of infrastructure that many\xa0reserves lack is what is usually provided by municipalities or provinces and territories. But under the Indian Act,\xa0this is the federal government\'s responsibility.But while most Canadians have provincial and municipal codes that guarantee minimum standards in areas such as water quality, First Nations are at the whim of policy, with no legislative framework to fall back on.Listen to CBC Radio\'s Karen Pauls report on life on\xa0two Manitoba reserves:Gary and Darlene McDougall and their five children share a cramped, cold home with no indoor plumbing in Wasagamack First Nation.\xa0LISTENThree generations of the Harper family live in a home on the Wasagamack reserve\xa0with no running water\xa0and a slop pail\xa0for a toilet.\xa0LISTENThe water problems on the Garden Hill First Nation have caught the attention of the Mennonite Central Committee, which usually works in developing countries.\xa0LISTEN""As a result, the services delivered\xa0… are not always well defined, and there is confusion about federal responsibility for funding them adequately,"" the\xa0June 2011 auditor general\'s report\xa0said.""It is not always evident whether the federal government is committed to providing services on reserves of the same range and quality as those provided to other communities across Canada.""Also, unlike cities or provinces, First Nations have no tax base and little independent revenue with which to fund infrastructure.While some communities have access to revenue from natural resources or\xa0commercial ventures, many are not so lucky and struggle with high rates of unemployment and low individual incomes, which puts more financial responsibility on the bands themselves.As well, the small size of many First Nations communities rules out the economies of scale that can help bring large infrastructure projects on line. Around 500,000 First Nations people live on reserves, but 79 per cent of these reserves have fewer than 1,000 residents, and 57 per cent have less than 500 residents.The federal funding that reserves do get is allocated on a year-to-year basis, which makes the kind of long-term planning that is essential for building infrastructure difficult.""Because these are simply policy line items in budgets and not fixed statutory long-term guarantees, there\'s an inability for a community to do the kind of planning that any community would expect to be able to accomplish,"" said Atleo.What\'s more, when funding\xa0does come,\xa0it can be\xa0out of sync with community needs.In remote northern communities, especially, the timing of federal budgets is not conducive to a construction window that is short and limited by weather and geography. Money often doesn\'t arrive until late summer, past the peak construction period, so\xa0projects get delayed and their\xa0costs rise.The auditor general criticized the government\'s funding approach as piecemeal and not always in line with its policies. The strategy for dealing with the rampant problem of mould contamination in houses on reserve, for example, focused on educating people about the problem but didn\'t provide the funding to eliminate it,\xa0the audit said.Atleo says such an approach leaves communities continually scrambling. When an injection of cash does come, it\'s often not enough to fully tackle a problem and usually comes out of the budget of some other community, which creates tensions between different First Nations and regions of the country.""The moment a community gets a school, it\'s like winning the lottery,"" Atleo says. ""There might be resources for only a few\xa0schools per year when 40 are needed. And then, when those few communities do get their schools, they\'ll be so far behind the eight ball, because the design and the resources to run their schools aren\'t there for the long run.""Another obstacle to improving infrastructure on reserves is what the auditor general described as the ""burdensome"" reporting requirements that First Nations face when accessing\xa0federal funds.In 2009-10, the AANDC required a total of 32,000 reports from 600 First Nations, the report found.This cumbersome federal bureaucracy overwhelms what are often small communities with little administrative capacity.\xa0A federal evaluation of First Nations housing found that when the Paul Martin government released $295 million in extra funding for housing in\xa0 2005, many First Nations said they didn\'t have the staff to figure out how to access\xa0the money and fulfill the additional reporting requirements and conditions.Others say that even when they do supply all the right paperwork, they sometimes don\'t hear back for months.""Basically, it can really get lost just by landing on the wrong desk,"" says Clint Barton, the 39-year-old housing manager of Gingolx, one of four villages that make up the Nisga\'a First Nation on the northwest coast of B.C. ""Sometimes, we\'d wait a year to get an answer on an application\xa0— only after we had to resubmit it three or four times.""The failure of the current system has forced some First Nations leaders to look outside the sphere of government for help with their infrastructure needs.Earlier this fall, Atleo addressed Canada\'s philanthropic community, urging\xa0it to focus its charity away from development projects in the Third World and\xa0toward First Nations communities, many of which have living conditions that aren\'t that far off from those in developing countries.He has also encouraged partnerships with private industry, soliciting the advice of celebrity renovator\xa0Mike Holmes\xa0and groups like Habitat for Humanity.Atleo says he\'s turned to these measures ""only because the needs are so dire, they\'re so immediate.""""What\'s really required is an expression of political will,"" he said.Some First Nations frustrated with the status quo have decided to break with the federal system altogether and signed self-governance agreements that will eventually make them financially independent.Tsawwassen First Nation, a Coast Salish community 25 kilometres south of Vancouver, signed a self-governance treaty with B.C. and the federal government that took effect in 2009.It\'s an urban community with valuable assets like\xa0proximity to a commercial port\xa0and\xa0revenue from private residential developments, so the transition was easier than it would be for more remote and poorer First Nations.Still, it was not without its challenges. Tsawwassen is having to create dozens of new laws and government structures and take on financial burdens previously assumed by the federal government, including about $100 million in needed infrastructure upgrades —\xa0none of which Chief Kim Baird would trade for the old status quo.""There isn\'t enough money through Indian Affairs to pay for major capital investment in infrastructure like local governments have,""\xa0she said.""The problem under the Indian reserve system is that the capital deficit is just so enormous.""When we went into self-government, we knew we were taking on that responsibility, and it wasn\'t something we were too happy to take on\xa0… but the federal government was really failing us in that regard.""Baird says one of her proudest moments post-treaty was when Tsawwassen was able to access $9 million in federal infrastructure funds through the economic stimulus program as equal partners with the province and the federal government (each contributed $3 million to develop Tsawwassen\'s industrial lands near the port).""One of the big surprises to me\xa0is the fact that everyone recognizes us as another government now,"" she said. ""Before, we were constantly asserting it, but no one treated us that way. Now, when we walk into a situation, it\'s a given, and that\'s really, really changed the dynamics in any number of situations.""Since moving to self-government and becoming part of Metro Vancouver, Baird has also witnessed what a benefit it can be to be integrated into regional and local government structures, which have legislation in place that enable communities to be able to pay for infrastructure and other needs.""Even though municipalities are a creature of provincial government, it\'s integrated in a way that municipalities can succeed whereas there\'s this disconnect with the reserve system to reality,"" Baird said.""What it has allowed me to see is just how inadequate the Indian Act system really is as far as having a separate legal, political system and structure for First Nations that are so not integrated with the rest of Canadian society in any way. It\'s quite alarming, actually, and really tells me why reserves are facing so many problems.""Audience Relations, CBC P.O.
