I can\'t do this alone\'"" his mother told the Viens Commission.Gull promised her son she\'d meet him in Montreal as soon as she could, and the parents began the eight-hour drive toward the Ste-Justine children\'s hospital.As they were driving through the night,\xa0a doctor and a\xa0social worker called them to ask why they had not accompanied their son on the plane.Then, her voice echoing through the car on the speaker phone, the doctor said she suspected Pelle\'s\xa0bleeding was possibly due to a problem in his liver.""To hear that something is wrong with my son\'s liver while I\'m driving is not a good feeling,"" Gull said.That drive is something many parents from Quebec\'s remote communities have experienced.In January 2018, a group of doctors\xa0wrote to the health minister, demanding that the\xa0practice of not allowing a parent to accompany their child onboard these flights be stopped.Then-Health Minister Gaétan Barrette announced in February his government would review the policy.Nine months later, one of the doctors who first highlighted the problem said he has seen improvements.Dr.\xa0Samir\xa0Shaheen-Hussain\xa0is a pediatric emergency physician and assistant professor in the faculty of medicine at\xa0McGill\xa0University.Those numbers have even increased in the\xa0past few weeks,\xa0Shaheen-Hussain\xa0told Quebec AM.""Compared to 100 per cent\xa0refusal rate, that\'s good. But compared to the rest of Canada or other countries around the world, we\'re nowhere near where we need to be,"" he said.Shaheen-Hussain\xa0has testified twice at the Viens\xa0Commission, including this week, and heard Pelle\xa0Jr\'s\xa0story.""It was heart-wrenching,"" he said.""Both those parents put\xa0into words what we\'ve been saying for months\xa0— what people have actually been saying for years, if not decades.""Shaheen-Hussain\xa0said the\xa0trauma Pelle\xa0and his family experienced on being separated\xa0is something doctors aren\'t privy to, but was front and centre\xa0in Gull and Loon\'s testimonies.Gull said once she reached the hospital, exhausted and disoriented, she was again asked by medical staff why she had not gotten on the plane with her son.Pelle\xa0Jr. would not speak to her at first. When he did, he asked her if he was going to die.""I\xa0can\'t imagine what was going through his mind when he got on that airplane alone,"" Gull said in tears.Weeks later, back home in Waswanipi,\xa0Pelle\xa0Jr. stares blankly at the wall whenever his parents mention the airplane.""I\'ve never seen that look on his face before,"" she said.Pelle\xa0Jr. reacted well to treatment, but his liver could stop functioning eventually, and he\xa0has been put on an organ transplant list.Gull said the constant worry that the internal bleeding could start again weighs heavily on the family.""I\'m constantly thinking,\xa0\'Do I have enough gas in my car, do I have enough funds to go to Montreal again,"" said Gull.Both parents took\xa0time off work following the incident, feeling ""physically and emotionally"" drained, said Loon.Gull told the Viens\xa0Commission she hoped changes would be made, ""not only for my son but also for other children, so they don\'t have to be medevaced on an airplane alone.""She said she was especially worried for children in her community who only speak Cree, and who can\'t communicate in French or English.\xa0""There\'s no cost, no price tag that anyone can put on those things,"" he said.With files from CBC\'s Quebec AM.Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

An Indian status card is proof the bearer is registered as a status\xa0Indian under the Indian Act.\xa0The current on-reserve tax exemptions stem\xa0from the Indian Act.""Five [card]\xa0types included the Canadian flag or maple leaf,"" said a redacted version of the report provided to CBC News by the department.The report said that one card — issued by the Confederation\xa0of Aboriginal Peoples of Canada (CAPC) — used the word ""government"" in between a Canadian flag logo and the word Canada.""The cards could appear to have been issued by the government of Canada,"" said the report.CAPC uses Indigenous ancestry DNA tests conducted by Toronto lab Viaguard Accu-Metrics to determine its card-holding membership.Earlier this year,\xa0CBC News reported\xa0the lab returned positive Indigenous ancestry results on two dog DNA samples. The lab also found three CBC employees born in India\xa0and Russia had the same percentage of Indigenous ancestry.Guillaume Carle, the grand chief of CAPC, said he still sends DNA samples to Viaguard Accu-Metrics for testing and doesn\'t fear the investigations.""The card is legal;\xa0we are recognized as the government,"" said Carle.\xa0""I don\'t know what they can investigate because we are all legal.""The lab\'s owner, Harvey Tenenbaum, did not respond to a request for comment.The KPMG report said the Sû\u200breté du Québec (SQ) began its investigation in November 2017 on a referral from police in Chateauguay, Que., which sits next to Kahnawake.An SQ spokesperson said the provincial police force does not comment on ongoing investigations.\xa0An RCMP spokesperson said the force also does not comment on ongoing investigations.KPMG investigators met with the Kahnawake Mohawk Peacekeepers during their investigation. They\xa0provided 28 occurrence reports involving individuals caught using the cards to receive goods tax-free on the reserve.Purchases delivered to a reserve for people with Indian status are tax-exempt.KPMG\'s report said 24 of the occurrence reports included deliveries of a car, truck or van.The report said retailers believed the fake cards to be real.The majority of individuals involved in the purchases lived in Montreal, but others were found to reside in northern Quebec and in the Gaspé Peninsula, said the report.The report said Kahnawake Peacekeepers seized cards apparently\xa0issued by a number of groups including:The report said individuals paid between $40 to $1,000 for the cards.The KPMG report takes particular note of CAPC, which is headquartered in Gatineau, Que.KPMG investigators interviewed an individual — whose name is redacted from the report — who stated that some prospective members paid $250 to CPAC for DNA tests that were never conducted.The individual told KPMG that some of the DNA test results were photocopied and altered with Wite-Out. \xa0The report also noted that this individual referred to dog DNA and tap water sent for tests that returned with positive Native American ancestry results.Carle said the allegations are false, because each test is accompanied by fingerprints and information from federal or provincial government issued ID.""Dogs don\'t have fingerprints,"" Carle said.Jorge BarreraReporterJorge Barrera is a Caracas-born, award-winning journalist who has worked across the country and internationally.
